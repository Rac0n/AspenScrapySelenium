Warrant active for man accused of ripping off Aspen restaurants,"<p class=""oc-body"">A man is wanted for failing to appear in court last week to answer charges that he allegedly stole fine cigars and a bottle of wine from an Aspen liquor store and refused to pay for two restaurant meals because he said one was tainted with pork and the other with hair.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Pitkin County Judge Ashley Andrews issued a warrant for the arrest of Shawn Auer at the close of courthouse hours May 17 after he allegedly failed to appear for a status conference concerning a multitude of offenses he faces. The charges recently were consolidated into one case.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“I’m concerned that there could be a another theft and really I’m concerned Mr. Auer is not going to show up for court,” said prosecutor Wes Stokes, noting Auer’s criminal history includes charges of shoplifting and theft in New Mexico, where he also failed to make scheduled court appearances. Stokes’ remarks came during last week’s court session where Auer was a no-show.</p> <img loading=""lazy"" width=""357"" height=""1251"" src=""https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=c9eb061c-4960-5c8f-89dc-a405fafa71b1&amp;type=preview&amp;width=357&amp;height=436&amp;q=60"" srcset=""https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=c9eb061c-4960-5c8f-89dc-a405fafa71b1&amp;type=preview&amp;width=300&amp;height=366&amp;q=60 300w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=c9eb061c-4960-5c8f-89dc-a405fafa71b1&amp;type=preview&amp;width=768&amp;height=938&amp;q=60 768w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=c9eb061c-4960-5c8f-89dc-a405fafa71b1&amp;type=preview&amp;width=1024&amp;height=1251&amp;q=60 1024w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=c9eb061c-4960-5c8f-89dc-a405fafa71b1&amp;type=preview&amp;width=2048&amp;height=2501&amp;q=60 2048w"" alt=""""> <p class=""oc-body"">Charging documents for Auer list his current residence as Belleville, Illinois, and his age as 48. He remained at large as of Monday, according to officials.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Auer’s recent dust-ups at local businesses are documented in police filings.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">• May 6 — Aspen police were called to Steakhouse 316 on East Hopkins Avenue for report of a patron who was unhappy with his meal because of a strand of hair he claimed was in his food. The diner, Auer, was comped for the food containing the hair but refused to pay for the rest of the meal, according to a police report.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“Auer adamantly refused to pay his bill and I explained to him that if he has an issue with the restaurant what avenues he could take, but he can’t eat and drink and not pay his bill,” responding Officer Amanda Severin wrote in the report. “Auer didn’t seem to care. I asked him numerous times if he would pay the bill and Auer said he will not pay the bill and to arrest him.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Police did that and took him to Aspen Police Department and an officer issued a summons for misdemeanor theft, read him his rights and told him not to return to the restaurant or face trespassing charges.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">• May 13 — Shortly after 7 p.m., police arrested Auer at the Red Mountain Grill at the Aspen Golf Course after he allegedly refused to pay a bill for a meal he had there earlier in the week. Auer was on the premises that day looking for rental clubs, and Red Mountain Grill management had kept the receipt for his unpaid meal from days earlier. When a manager confronted Auer about the outstanding receipt, “Auer became belligerent with the staff by yelling and cussing at them, and posturing like he was going to fight,” according to a witness statement to police.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Police arrived and Auer denied any wrongdoing, according to a report from Officer Severin, who had cited him a week earlier for the hair-in-the-food dispute.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“I told Auer he is making it a habit of eating at places and refusing to pay,” said Severin’s report of the May 13 incident. “Auer yelled at me that Red Mountain Grill poisoned him by serving him pork.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Auer had previously complained that the restaurant staff had “poisoned him” because he’s “100% Jewish” and can’t consume pork.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Management also said Auer had been scheduling tee times at the course under the name of “Leo Christ” but was not keeping his appointments.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Again, police took Auer took to downtown headquarters where he was summonsed for misdemeanor theft and disorderly conduct. Police also let Auer know he’d been 86ed from Red Mountain Grill and the golf club. He was then released from custody.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">• May 13 — Later on that date, at approximately 9:01 p.m., police received a call from The Aspen Store about a man who swiped some power drinks and was behaving aggressively toward the store clerk. Auer was not at the store at the time police responded, but Officer Ritchie Zah located him down the block in the dining area outside of Mi Chola, according to a report from Officer Roderick O’Connor.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“I asked Auer, who was smoking a cigar, about his stealing drinks from The Aspen Store and where the bag he took was located,” O’Connor’s report said. “Auer was not forthcoming about the bag, but mentioned he was at Mi Chola to eat.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">O’Connor, however, arrested Auer for theft after he found the power drinks in a bag Auer had left inside the restaurant. It was the second time in the same evening Auer had been cited for theft, but the pork meal and power drinks weren’t all he had allegedly taken.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Officer Severin, who also reported to Mi Chola, also found Auer in possession of one bottle of Opus One Cabernet with a price tag of $389.99, along with four cigars valued at $52.87. Those items had been swiped from the Local Spirits shop next to The Aspen Store, O’Connor reported.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Auer appeared for his advisement on May 14, but that is the last authorities had heard of him as of Monday.</p> <p class=""oc-body""><em id=""emphasis-8c75815ae60d46994ffbeed1ab926cd9""><a href=""mailto:rcarroll@aspentimes.com"">rcarroll@aspentimes.com</a></em></p> ",Rick Carroll,24 May 2022,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/six-rafters-including-four-children-saved-from-roaring-fork-rivers-strong-currents/

It had been done before, Hannah said: Legend has it some guy used to hike up Buttermilk and cook hot dogs at the top of Tiehack. We weren’t sure who, but much of the evidence pointed to a dear friend who I’d consider “a notorious fan of hot dogs.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Which prompted a follow-up: What foodstuffs were we “notorious fans” of? After some lengthy mulling, Henry landed on raw meat and fish of the tartare and sushi varieties. But it took less than 30 seconds to determine where my reputation lies: “a notorious fan of cookbooks” was the obvious answer.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">I’ll be the first to acknowledge that my enthusiasm for recipes might come off as “a bit much.” I’ve covered a wall in my living room with the back covers of Cook’s Illustrated magazine and lined the table below end to end with recipe collections and kitchen-adjacent literature. “The Cookbook Collector,” a novel I devoured, is in that stack; maybe a little too on the nose, eh?</p> <p class=""oc-body"">But I also believe this enthusiasm is warranted, especially for the old yarns and great fun that I find in reading old lists of ingredients and instructions and introductions. I got hooked in college, in a “Cookbooks and History” class furnished by a spectacular collection of collectibles and handwritten recipe cards; these days, the Aspen Thrift Store enables my habit and enhances it.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">You, too, can find the treasure trove at Aspen Thrift, right at the bottom of the stairs on the lower floor. It’s just about the best collection I’ve ever seen outside of a university setting (though I’ll confess I have not seen too many non-collegiate compilations), better yet because I get to keep what I find.</p> <img loading=""lazy"" width=""4032"" height=""768"" src=""https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=d1a22fc3-b64e-54ff-a827-818b938c926d&amp;type=preview&amp;width=4032&amp;height=3024&amp;q=60"" srcset=""https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=d1a22fc3-b64e-54ff-a827-818b938c926d&amp;type=preview&amp;width=300&amp;height=225&amp;q=60 300w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=d1a22fc3-b64e-54ff-a827-818b938c926d&amp;type=preview&amp;width=768&amp;height=576&amp;q=60 768w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=d1a22fc3-b64e-54ff-a827-818b938c926d&amp;type=preview&amp;width=1024&amp;height=768&amp;q=60 1024w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=d1a22fc3-b64e-54ff-a827-818b938c926d&amp;type=preview&amp;width=2048&amp;height=1536&amp;q=60 2048w"" alt=""""> <p class=""oc-body"">Among the treats I’ve found on those shelves: “The New York Times Cookbook” (1961) and its siblings, “The New York Times Menu Cookbook” (1966) and “The New York Times International Cookbook” (1971), all with recipes from the New York Times, and a 1971 edition of “The Playboy Host and Bar Book” and a 1979 edition “The Playboy Gourmet,” with hundreds of recipes each from Playboy magazine (yes, that Playboy).</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Tucked in the stacks, I’ve got “Beard on Bread,” a 1979 education of bread recipes by James Beard, and “Kitchen Classics from the Philharmonic,” a 1992 compilation of recipes and classical music pairings from affiliates of the New York Philharmonic.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">But my favorite acquisitions are most often the community cookbooks that contain so much of Aspen’s history in their pages. I treasure my 1988 “Snowmass Chapel Cookbook,” which features familiar names and sections like “Chapel Pastries,” “Backpack Yummies” and “Balloon Festival Breakfasts.”</p> <img loading=""lazy"" width=""4032"" height=""768"" src=""https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=059e9f56-0afa-50a1-a667-153c17b50596&amp;type=preview&amp;width=4032&amp;height=3024&amp;q=60"" srcset=""https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=059e9f56-0afa-50a1-a667-153c17b50596&amp;type=preview&amp;width=300&amp;height=225&amp;q=60 300w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=059e9f56-0afa-50a1-a667-153c17b50596&amp;type=preview&amp;width=768&amp;height=576&amp;q=60 768w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=059e9f56-0afa-50a1-a667-153c17b50596&amp;type=preview&amp;width=1024&amp;height=768&amp;q=60 1024w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=059e9f56-0afa-50a1-a667-153c17b50596&amp;type=preview&amp;width=2048&amp;height=1536&amp;q=60 2048w"" alt=""""> <p class=""oc-body"">A recent find, “Recipe Requests from the Mace Kitchens” from 1999, is a relic of hearty health foods from the Stuart and Isabel Mace’s family operations up at Toklat at Ashcroft and at Malachite, a farm at the base of Mt.

Almost. Hardly.” I found the book, a collection of “Interesting Recipes for the Lethargic Gourmet,” at last year’s Aspen Thrift Shop art sale. The back cover informed me that Koffend ran the “eclectic” Uriah Heep’s shop in Aspen for 25 years, hosted a daily “Aspen A.M.” show on TV with her two pugs and staked claim to the title of “oldest living cookbook author.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">I scooped the book mostly for its quirky illustrations and its even quirkier recipes that fulfill the promise of the title — recipes like “Tomato/Orange Soup,” which calls for just two cups of orange juice and two of cream of tomato soup and claims to have a “very nice ‘mystery taste,’” and “Beets with Sour Cream,” which calls for canned beets and dollops sour cream. (Some are more elaborate, like the collections of quiches and souffles.)</p> <p class=""oc-body"">But I’m keeping it around less for the menu than for Koffend’s clever, generous voice, preserved in the book she published just a year before she died in 2005.

When two vehicles met, one had to pull over to let the other pass.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Their friends thought they were crazy moving “so far” out of town. For them, the ranch has always remained a “godsend” for 56 years. They live in the same humble house. A majestic red barn makes the property particularly eye-catching. Plus the fact that there are usually scores of elk lounging in the pastures during cold-weather months. Tom estimated 250 head of elk were taking refuge on the ranch just north of his house during the late-season snowstorm Friday.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“They’re all pretty good friends,” he quipped.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">But development of luxury mansions has changed the character of the area, pressing in on both sides of the ranch.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“There’s got to be something done about it,” Moore said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">About 18 months ago, negotiations on a conservation proposal with Pitkin County ratcheted up a notch. On Wednesday, the county commissioners will consider an ordinance to strike a deal with the Moore family to purchase a portion of their ranch outright and obtain a conservation easement on much of the remainder. The contract is for up to $10 million.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The property is zoned for one house per 20 acres, so it could yield up to 13 lots under a development scheme. At today’s real estate prices, the Moore family could reap much more than the $10 million the county is offering.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“They’d rather have a family legacy of conservation than squeeze every penny out of it,” said Dale Will, acquisition and special projects director for Pitkin County Open Space and Trails.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">A memo from Will to the county commissioners lays out details of the proposal. Pitkin County would obtain about 95 acres of the Moore property west of McLain Flats Road. On the east side of the road, a conservation easement would be placed on 135 acres owned in full by the Moore family. That parcel includes the iconic ranch house and barn. There is the potential to place a conservation easement on an additional 42 acres of the ranch that the Moores own with others. If those 42 acres aren’t part of the deal, the total price would be reduced to $9 million.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The Aspen City Council will consider contributing $1 million to the purchase, according to Will’s memo.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The Moores will receive approval for one new home on the 135 acres the family fully controls on the east side of the road. A second home site would be approved if the 42 acres they own with other parties is part of the deal. Tom and Carolyn’s farmhouse will be historically designated and preserved.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Will said the Moore property purchase and conservation easement checks all the boxes for the open space program. It preserves agricultural lands and view planes. There is clearly wildlife benefit and an opportunity to enhance recreation.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The 95 acres on the west side of the road lie within the Roaring Fork Gorge corridor, a 390-acre assemblage of properties already acquired by the open space program, Aspen Parks and Aspen Valley Land Trust.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Will’s memo said the 95-acre parcel to be acquired from the Moores “contains an intact sagebrush shrubland that is increasingly rare in the upper Roaring Fork Valley and provides important habitat for migratory songbirds and other sagebrush-dependent species. This purchase will benefit both wildlife and recreationists along the (Rio Grande Trail), and allow future planning efforts to optimize both habitat effectiveness and potential soft trails consistent with that objective.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Of the 95 acres on the west side of the ranch, 15 acres are irrigated lands. The open space program would ensure that no structures are ever built in that “iconic viewshed” to preserve the view of Mount Daly and Sky Mountain Park to the west.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The property east of the road provides vital elk winter range and severe winter range on west-facing slopes.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“Anyone who travels the route between late fall and early spring cannot miss the fact that the Moore Ranch has become a sanctuary for Rocky Mountain elk, especially during their vulnerable migration and transition periods during the colder months,” Will’s memo said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Irrigated meadows on the ranch are leased for hay production, which Will said remains an option for the future.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Tom and Carolyn Moore already have a lengthy track record of taking action for the good of the community. They were inducted into the <a href=""https://aspenhalloffame.org/inductee/carolyn-tom-moore/"" target=""_blank"">Aspen Hall of Fame</a><svg class=""svg-icon""><use class=""fa-external-link-alt"" xlink:href=""#fa-external-link-alt""></use></svg> in 2014 for all their endeavors and community involvement.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">In addition to numerous volunteer efforts, they also donated land for the Aspen public school campus and for the Aspen Valley Ski Club headquarters. They were the first people to work with the open space program on a land sale.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“The first major purchase of the nascent Pitkin County Open Space Program in 1993 was Moore Open Space, which lies on the boundary into Aspen and is now one of the crown jewels of our program,” Will’s memo said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The Moore open space provides land for a critical part of the Nordic trail system.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The Aspen Times detailed the Moores’ <a href=""https://www.aspentimes.com/news/giving-moore-to-aspen/"">community involvement</a> in a 2013 feature story.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">For Tom, who was born in Aspen in 1942, this latest conservation arrangement ensures that a little slice of heaven remains the same in a rapidly changing community.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Tom and Carolyn will remain in what he called their “antique home.” It was a Sears Roebuck kit house that shipped to Woody Creek by rail and then was likely loaded onto hay wagons and moved on-site in the 1920s, Tom said. The barn  also was a kit. It’s now Tom’s wood shop and office, what he called his “man barn.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Be it ever so humble, there’s no place like home.</p> <p class=""oc-body""><em id=""emphasis-a81937abc4761662681ecdb627f501a7""><a href=""mailto:scondon@aspentimes.com"">scondon@aspentimes.com</a></em></p> ",Scott Condon,21 May 2022,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/six-rafters-including-four-children-saved-from-roaring-fork-rivers-strong-currents/

She died in late April at the age of 75, Solheim wrote in an email.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“You’d meet her once, you never ever forgot her,” Solheim said. “She was a big personality and an incredible force, and she could almost, like, rip someone to pieces and build you up in like the same breath because she actually cared about people, so she had this wisdom and ability to really see what it was that you needed. And through that … a lot of people felt like she was a mother figure.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">And, to Maria Smithburg, a friend of two decades, “like a sister — we could talk about anything,” Smithburg said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“She basically spoke her mind. She was not someone that would go around the bushes, and I think I appreciate that,” Smithburg said. “Other people just are too formal in their friendships. She was a true friend that really wanted to know how you were feeling. … She really cared.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Smithburg, who lives in Chicago but has a home in Aspen, met Hower at a party and instantly clicked, finding in Hower “someone that fell in love with Aspen like I did and was able to share that love with other people,” she said.</p> <img loading=""lazy"" width=""3024"" height=""1365"" src=""https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=46bea1ef-defd-57cf-bf65-6c969a942fd1&amp;type=preview&amp;width=3024&amp;height=4032&amp;q=60"" srcset=""https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=46bea1ef-defd-57cf-bf65-6c969a942fd1&amp;type=preview&amp;width=300&amp;height=400&amp;q=60 300w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=46bea1ef-defd-57cf-bf65-6c969a942fd1&amp;type=preview&amp;width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;q=60 768w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=46bea1ef-defd-57cf-bf65-6c969a942fd1&amp;type=preview&amp;width=1024&amp;height=1365&amp;q=60 1024w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=46bea1ef-defd-57cf-bf65-6c969a942fd1&amp;type=preview&amp;width=2048&amp;height=2731&amp;q=60 2048w"" alt=""""> <p class=""oc-body"">Hower’s enthusiasm for this town was one of her defining characteristics, Solheim said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“A lot of people have said to me that she was sort of ‘Miss Aspen’ to them, because … she had such a huge love for Aspen and it was contagious,” Solheim said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Hower caught the bug herself in the early 1970s, when she arrived in town for what she thought would be a single season in Aspen, Solheim said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“She had moved to New York to become an actress and a model, and my grandparents … they didn’t give her a lot of time to make that work, and they wanted her to come back to Detroit,” Solheim said. “And she said, ‘Just, please, one summer in Aspen, and then I’ll come home and comply and get married’ and do whatever women did back in that time.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">As the story so often goes, Hower spent a lot more than just the summer here.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“She just fell in love with Aspen to such an extent that she just couldn’t leave, at all costs,” Solheim said. “The nature and everything about it — the spirit of Aspen … the liberal spirit of Aspen and everything it’s good for — that was kind of like her religion, in a way.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">What she found in those early years was an immersion into Aspen’s counterculture scene in its ultimate heyday. She married Michael Solheim, the legendary manager of the Hotel Jerome’s J-Bar, and became party to the hub of intellectual and philosophical conversation (and debauchery, too) at the watering hole frequented by the likes of Hunter S. Thompson, Jack Nicholson and Tom Benton.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“She obviously wasn’t like the celebrity part of that because that was them, but she was a big part of that life,” Evan Solheim said. Hower was matter-of-fact in her involvement even then: When the need arose to serve food at the bar, “my mom just said no problem — I’ll learn how to cook,” Solheim said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">That steadfast pragmatism was one that would carry Hower throughout her life, much of which she spent as a single mother and real estate agent and developer after she separated from Michael Solheim. Her motivation for success was the ability to provide for her two daughters, Smithburg suggested.</p> <img loading=""lazy"" width=""2076"" height=""1365"" src=""https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=281b7ad4-163e-5969-81b3-7c0362d798c4&amp;type=preview&amp;width=2076&amp;height=2768&amp;q=60"" srcset=""https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=281b7ad4-163e-5969-81b3-7c0362d798c4&amp;type=preview&amp;width=300&amp;height=400&amp;q=60 300w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=281b7ad4-163e-5969-81b3-7c0362d798c4&amp;type=preview&amp;width=768&amp;height=1024&amp;q=60 768w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=281b7ad4-163e-5969-81b3-7c0362d798c4&amp;type=preview&amp;width=1024&amp;height=1365&amp;q=60 1024w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=281b7ad4-163e-5969-81b3-7c0362d798c4&amp;type=preview&amp;width=2048&amp;height=2731&amp;q=60 2048w"" alt=""""> <p class=""oc-body"">“I think that was a driving force for her to try and do the best she could in her real estate world, and she did it out of a desire to be successful, but also to be there for her children and all their needs,” Smithburg said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Hower was a “risk taker” who “learned from the street” and dove into the field with gusto despite no background in development or home sales, Solheim said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“She took that risk, not only to go into real estate when she had literally no business experience whatsoever, and really hadn’t worked in a real job besides a few random things here and there, but to turn it around and make what she did of it is incredible,” Solheim said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The evidence of that work is everywhere in this town and beyond it.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“There’s probably not a neighborhood in all of Aspen that doesn’t have a house that she built,” said Victoria Barrena, who knew Hower both as a fellow real estate agent and a fellow Aspen mom. (Barrena now splits her time between Aspen and Florida.)</p> <p class=""oc-body"">In the offseasons, when business slowed, “I think she was the first person I would call pretty much every day. … I knew her number off by heart,” Barrena said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Hower’s success in real estate was part and parcel of her “individualistic” approach to life, Barrena noted.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“She was very successful, really hardworking, and just a real — very individual, very, very independent person,” Barrena added.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Hower’s imprint on the landscape of Aspen, Snowmass and beyond isn’t necessarily a flashy one, but it’s fitting for the person that Hower was, Solheim said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“The fact that (the homes she developed are) there, and that they’re almost — they’re just blending into the environment, it kind of is reflective of the type of person she was: that she just was kind of just no-nonsense, she just did her business and had her successes,” Solheim said. “She didn’t need any accolades, or to be recognized for anything. She was just doing it for her family and for her own self worth.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Hower is survived by her mother, Roslyn Hower, her daughters Lauren Skye and Evan (and son-in-law Thomas Blondin) and grandchildren James, Olivia and Georgie. She was preceded in death by her father Felix and sister Barbara and ex-husband Michael Solheim.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">In lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made in Hower’s name to Aspen Junior Golf. The family plans to organize a celebration of life this August at the Red Butte Cemetery where Hower is buried.</p> <p class=""oc-body""><a href=""mailto:kwilliams@aspentimes.com"">kwilliams@aspentimes.com</a></p> ",Kaya Williams,21 May 2022,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/six-rafters-including-four-children-saved-from-roaring-fork-rivers-strong-currents/

They are now in the process of building a new bridge in that location, Veldhuis said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The remainder of the five bridges were not severely damaged, but crews are working to build a primitive trail through some of the debris flow areas to provide a walkable access to the lake, she said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“We’ve been really impressed with the work that’s been done to date,” she said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Long term, the National Forest Foundation expects to invest more than $3 million over the next three years to build a new, more resilient permanent trail with additional improvements, interpretive signage and restoration of the ecology along the trail that was damaged by the mudslides and by the 2020 Grizzly Creek Fire, said Jamie Werner, stewardship coordinator between the WRNF and the National Forest Foundation.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Design work for that larger project is to begin later this summer, she said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“The goal with the temporary trail work is to open the trail to safe public access,” Werner said. “We will still be keeping an eye on the weather through the summer and potentially instigating some closures for dangerous weather events.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“The long-term plan for that permanent trail is to be looking at it from a holistic perspective … the alignment, the materials, the user experience … all those things to make this trail as sturdy and resilient and sustainable as possible,” she said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The larger project includes funding from a $2.28 million Great Outdoors Colorado Community Impact Grant that was awarded last year, along with the city of Glenwood Springs, the Forest Service, the Glenwood Canyon Restoration Alliance and Hanging Lake visitors who donated their canceled permit reservation fees from last summer back to the rebuilding effort, Werner said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Glenwood Springs Mayor Pro-Tem Charlie Willman also spoke at the Wednesday opening announcement.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“We heard clearly over this past year how important Hanging Lake is to Colorado, and we know how important it is to our local community, its character and its economic vibrancy,” Willman said. “We’re so grateful to those who made this happen, and it’s going to be exciting to have it accessible this summer much sooner than anyone anticipated.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Reservations to hike to Hanging Lake are $12 per person, with the exception of small children who can be carried the entire way. A permit includes parking at the rest area.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">There is a limit of 615 visitors per day in accordance with the Forest Service’s management plan that was implemented in 2019. Up until then, the area saw as many as 1,800 hikers on peak summer days, Langer said, resulting in overcrowding at the parking area and illegal parking along the Interstate 70 on/off ramps and leading to the development of the management plan.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">One requirement when the new reservation system was implemented was that hikers had to use a shuttle service between Glenwood Springs and the Hanging Lake trailhead.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The shuttle, operated under contract by H2O Ventures of Glenwood Springs, which also handles reservations, was in place in 2019. It has since been suspended, at first due to pandemic restrictions in 2020, and since the Grizzly Creek Fire due to the potential for evacuations during flood events on the fire burn scar.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The shuttle will remain suspended this year, as trail managers would prefer that people have quick access to their personal vehicles in case of a flash flood watch or warning and the potential for an evacuation order during this summer’s monsoonal rains.</p> <p class=""oc-body""><em id=""emphasis-46b34f77d08113cb28f875212580dcb5"">Senior Reporter/Managing Editor John Stroud can be reached at 970-384-9160 or <a href=""mailto:jstroud@postindependent.com"" target=""_blank"">jstroud@postindependent.com</a><svg class=""svg-icon""><use class=""fa-external-link-alt"" xlink:href=""#fa-external-link-alt""></use></svg>.</em></p> ",John Stroud,20 May 2022,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/six-rafters-including-four-children-saved-from-roaring-fork-rivers-strong-currents/

But how that should look and what all it might entail is something town leaders want residents to help determine.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“This outreach event is called a ‘vision party’ because we want the community to get excited about the possibilities and opportunities, Mayor Ben Bohmfalk said of the June 3 event. “We will have ice cream and family-friendly creative activities coordinated by Carbondale Arts.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Town Manager Lauren Gister said it’s an opportunity for the town to develop a project with community interest and desires in mind.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“We gained a lot of insight from the outreach conducted during the town’s Comprehensive Plan update, such as the need for more affordable housing and community commercial driven spaces like live-work and makers spaces. But we want to know what else we should consider.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Earlier this year, the town hired Carbondale-based planning consultant Bob Schultz to do some research on past development plans and analyze the properties for future potential.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Gister said during a Carbondale Board of Trustees work session this week that the June 3 event will have displays with information about the properties and offer a variety of interactive opportunities for the public to engage in the process.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“We plan to have anywhere from six to nine stations with lots of creative ways to just get the ideas flowing, and also to inform the public about what studies have already been done and are already out there … that feed into how we look at developing a piece of property or guide someone else in developing a property,” Gister said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Examples are the valleywide housing needs assessment that was done in 2018 and the town’s Comprehensive Plan, which is currently being updated, she said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The community engagement and feedback efforts are to continue throughout June, including during the town board’s June 21 work session, she said.

Thank you for your hard work, your positive attitudes, your leadership, and your smiles. We will miss you and remember, you will always be Longhorns!”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Basalt High School’s graduation ceremony is slated to take place at 10 a.m. Saturday inside the school in the main gym, according to a Facebook post that Roaring Fork School District shared around noon on Friday.

This had the two BHS teachers questioning the legitimacy of those diplomas they were about to hand out.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“Definitely not their first bad decision, and probably won’t be their last,” Huntsman quipped to <a href=""https://www.aspentimes.com/news/by-the-numbers-basalt-high-school-grads-have-big-plans-for-the-future/"">the Class of 2022</a> about its selection. “In reality, your class had to face a tremendous amount of adversity throughout school. Online school, in-person school, online slash in-person school, in-person school when the teachers were online, teachers mumbling through masks, and countless last-minute changes, like an indoor graduation.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Nearly 100 Basalt students graduated Saturday inside the BHS gymnasium. Normally held outside on the football field, an overnight winter storm forced school officials to move the event into the main gym.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Just another hurdle to overcome for a class that has had to overcome its fair share of them over the past four years as Longhorns.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“We all dealt with COVID, switching to online learning and the excitement of switching back to in-person. We made it past all the trials and tribulations and got to experience our senior year,” BHS Salutatorian Francesca Savi said during her speech.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“For the last 13 years, we have grown together in both height and maturity. We have made mistakes and learned from them. We have built friendships and watched them fade. We have been through events in our community that others may never understand. We’ve had the fortune of having our teachers educate in a way that not only helps us with issues in the classroom, but also outside of the classroom, too.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">BHS Principal Peter Mueller kicked off the ceremony, pointing out a handful of students. This included Marlon Nelson, whose bear hug of Mueller in the school hallway back in December when students returned to the classroom left quite the impression on the longtime administrator.</p> <img loading=""lazy"" width=""2400"" height=""819"" src=""https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=91234ccd-2a30-593e-a8b7-173a5482ac17&amp;type=preview&amp;width=2400&amp;height=1920&amp;q=60"" srcset=""https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=91234ccd-2a30-593e-a8b7-173a5482ac17&amp;type=preview&amp;width=300&amp;height=240&amp;q=60 300w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=91234ccd-2a30-593e-a8b7-173a5482ac17&amp;type=preview&amp;width=768&amp;height=614&amp;q=60 768w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=91234ccd-2a30-593e-a8b7-173a5482ac17&amp;type=preview&amp;width=1024&amp;height=819&amp;q=60 1024w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=91234ccd-2a30-593e-a8b7-173a5482ac17&amp;type=preview&amp;width=2048&amp;height=1638&amp;q=60 2048w"" alt=""""> <p class=""oc-body"">Then there was Hanna Faulhaber, who captivated the entire Roaring Fork Valley this winter <a href=""https://www.aspentimes.com/news/after-olympic-experience-faulhaber-ready-to-start-grinding-again/"">when she made the U.S. Olympic team for halfpipe skiing</a> and carved out some time during spring training to walk across the stage and graduate in person Saturday.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“What I so appreciate about Marlon and this class is not just how you finished, but about how you learned in the process,” Mueller said. “The Class of 2022 has learned a lot these last four years. Overcoming adversity? Check. Seeing the joy in each other’s mask-free face? Check. Realizing that life is not about remote learning? Check, double check and check again.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Along with Savi, Valedictorian Emma Borchers addressed her classmates, bringing up her own personal struggles this past year that she hopes will only make her stronger as she heads to Dartmouth.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“Personally, this past year was one of the most challenging of my life. I faced an event that no one could have prepared me for, one that flipped my life around,” Borchers said. “After this challenge, I emerged a better version of myself. I was prepared to work harder, in school and out of school, to prove to myself that the challenge I faced didn’t define me.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Before the seniors were allowed to walk across the stage, an impressive percentage of the class was recognized as having received the school district’s seal of biliteracy, and two new names were added to the school’s “Wall of Fame” in Gage Reuss and Zulma Garcia Rivas.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“We wish we could tell you that the pandemic is over and everything will be easy. Unfortunately, life can be relentless and the challenges just keep coming,” Huntsman said during the class address.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“This class has also taught us the necessity of sacrifice in order to succeed. So, if you want to be an Olympian, or if you want to be great at anything, you have to work at it. We know you will have opportunities to succeed, but it won’t come without a cost. It won’t come without dedication, hard work and finding joy in what you do. And you guys find joy really well.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Aspen High School’s graduation is scheduled for June 4.</p> <p class=""oc-body""><a href=""mailto:acolbert@aspentimes.com"">acolbert@aspentimes.com</a></p> ",Austin Colbert,22 May 2022,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/six-rafters-including-four-children-saved-from-roaring-fork-rivers-strong-currents/

I feel this was similar, and those in-person meetings create an accountability that can get lost with just names on applications.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Godes said the group also emphasized how much a $33 million USDOT Rural Surface Transportation Grant could do for a fire evacuation route in southern Glenwood Springs via the South Bridge project.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">On May 13, Boebert met with the group and discussed challenges facing Glenwood Canyon, Cottonwood Pass and the South Bridge project, he said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“We had a conversation about how the canyon closing affects Glenwood Springs,” Godes added, “such as the impact on goods and services getting into the city and how it impacts people who travel I-70 for work.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">While the trip had a calculable cost — about $10,000 paid for from the city manager’s administrative budget — the return on investment is more speculative.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“We can’t say meeting these officials in D.C. is the reason we get all the grants we do,” Hanlon said. “But we can say that since we started making these trips, our grant funding has increased exponentially.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Godes said in addition to building relationships, meeting in person puts a face to a grant application and allows local representatives to craft the narrative behind the need for funding.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“When we show up,” he said, “we get grant funding.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Figueroa said city representatives have been visiting Washington, D.C., annually for about six years, and during that time, Glenwood Springs has received more than $24 million in federal, state and local grant funding.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Godes added, “I don’t know of any other community that has been as successful as us at leveraging federal and state dollars to accomplish our goals.”</p> <p class=""oc-body""><em id=""emphasis-6338c9b79075447507f5759aba9b40c5"">Reporter Ike Fredregill can be reached at 970-384-9154 or by email at <a href=""mailto:ifredregill@postindependent.com"" target=""_blank"">ifredregill@postindependent.com</a><svg class=""svg-icon""><use class=""fa-external-link-alt"" xlink:href=""#fa-external-link-alt""></use></svg>.</em></p> ",Ike Fredregill,24 May 2022,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/six-rafters-including-four-children-saved-from-roaring-fork-rivers-strong-currents/
"City of Aspen short-staffed in parks and rec, police","<p class=""oc-body"">Due to a growing labor shortage within the city of Aspen, the public should expect to experience a decrease in services this summer in community policing and parks and recreation.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">City Manager Sara Ott said 10% of full-time positions are vacant in the municipal government and even more so in the <a href=""https://www.aspentimes.com/news/city-of-aspen-planting-the-seeds-of-summer-with-fewer-hands/"">temporary, seasonal job pool</a>.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The city is trying to fill positions for lifeguards, camp counselors, softball umpires, parks maintenance, seasonal golf workers and more.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“We are going to have some softball games that don’t have an umpire or only have one umpire compared to the normal two,” Ott said last week. “Our locals are resilient, roll-with-it people, and I know it’s upsetting that these kinds of things are happening temporarily.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">A shortage of police officers will likely be noticeable, with five sworn positions and two community resource officers open.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“I have had command staff being the first on scene sometimes in the last six months, and that’s generally not the best situation for the community to be in,” Ott said. “The police department is one of the departments that I am concerned about.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Fewer officers on the force means fewer resources to respond to public safety calls like wildlife sightings.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“We are going to have a little less of people walking around as perhaps people experienced during the pandemic summers,” Ott said. “So when a bear gets stuck in a tree by its own choices, usually we have an officer who has stayed there the entire time, or a community safety officer, and that’s not necessarily going to be something that can happen.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The police department will set up a perimeter to keep the bear and humans safe, along with some educational messaging.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">If a neighborhood has concerns, they’ll be met when resources are available.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“We’ll certainly have folks there whenever we can, but it’s not necessarily going to be proactive,” Ott said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Aspen Police Chief Richard Pryor confirmed that all proactive patrol expectations such as walking the pedestrian malls, conducting traffic stops, patrolling the West End neighborhood and nighttime bar checks might be less frequent.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The reassignment of detectives and human service officers will likely cover patrol shifts, which may affect response to those with mental health issues and case investigations, he said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“Chiefs are filling some patrol shifts to cover for training for patrol staff and spending more time assisting with day-to-day operations,” Pryor said via email over the weekend. “The above being said, we are still able to meet minimum staffing goals for shifts.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Community resource officer staffing is 30% understaffed. Those officers cover wildlife issues, accidents and medical calls, among other things, and will have to prioritize responses as best they can, Pryor said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“Patrol officers will also cover those calls where possible,” he said, adding that it will take the burden off the force if people secure their trash containers to avoid bear activity.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Data for this year to date indicates an increase over 2021 call numbers but still fewer than pre-COVID-19 times in 2019, which hopefully continues to give the APD a bit of a break while it builds staffing back, Pryor said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The department does have enough capacity that it can re-task assistant chiefs, detectives, human service officers and a school resource officer should larger incidents occur.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The short staffing within the department is the result of three tenured officers retiring, along with usual turnover the department experiences regularly.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">If no one else leaves and all positions are filled soon, Pryor expects to be at full effective “on the street” staffing by May 2023.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">It can take a year to get an officer on the street, if the city spends three months recruiting, then the individual goes through six months in the police academy and then field training, Ott noted.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The city is offering a $3,500 sign-on, lateral transfer bonus for those who have peace officer certification.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Pryor said there are two new recruits who have been hired and are at the Breckenridge Police Academy and another one who will start in June and attend the August academy in Glenwood.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The APD has been short staffed before, and Pryor said he expects that the department will be able to give the quality service the public would hope to see most of the time.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“What I’d ask the community is just to be aware of our current constraints and that for lower priority calls to occasionally expect a slower response,” he said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">As for the rest of the seasonal and temporary positions open within the city, Ott said the municipal government is trying to be competitive with wage and benefit increases, but that’s proving not to be enough.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“There’s a beginning and end-of-season bonus and returning staff bonus program,” she said. “The crux of it comes back to housing.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“It doesn’t matter whether it’s a part-time or full-time job,” she continued. “Like every other employer, we are feeling the housing crunch and the loss of affordable free-market housing opportunities for locals.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Cuts to the hours of operation at the <a href=""https://www.aspentimes.com/news/aspen-recreation-center-faces-labor-shortage-reduces-hours/"">Aspen Recreation Center</a> or within parks programs are possible.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“I think ultimately we’re going to have to contemplate whether to request some service hour reductions with City Council,” Ott said. “I think we’ll make some announcements probably in June; we are going to keep pushing the <a href=""https://phe.tbe.taleo.net/phe03/ats/careers/v2/searchResults?org=ASPENGOV&amp;cws=44"" target=""_blank"">recruiting</a><svg class=""svg-icon""><use class=""fa-external-link-alt"" xlink:href=""#fa-external-link-alt""></use></svg> a little while longer, but we’ll have to make service level decisions and we’re going to prioritize weekday programming for particularly youth where it’s helping our working families for when school is out.”</p> <p class=""oc-body""><em id=""emphasis-907f3e28f5a07da3a3d5b845bbfcd8c9""><a href=""mailto:csackariason@aspentimes.com"">csackariason@aspentimes.com</a></em></p> <p class=""oc-body""> </p> ",Carolyn Sackariason,23 May 2022,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/six-rafters-including-four-children-saved-from-roaring-fork-rivers-strong-currents/

The spill ultimately resulted in about 2 million gallons of water flowing into Mill and Gore creeks.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">In a Sept. 21 investigation, Colorado Parks and Wildlife found water with a “bluish-white” tint where the system flowed into Mill Creek at a culvert near Vail’s Pirate Ship Park. The spill was visible on Gore Creek to a site just downstream of the Willow Bridge in Vail Village.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The investigation discovered 120 dead fish. The investigation also revealed dead algae and dead macroinvertebrates including worms and stoneflies.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">According to the report, water in the snowmaking pond had been treated with a “granular copper-based algaecide.” In addition, the potable water flowing into the pond is treated with chlorine.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The report refers to Vail Resorts as “Vail Corporation,” and notes that the spill qualifies as a “discharge of pollutants,” and that the company doesn’t have permits for any such discharge into Mill Creek.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The notice also includes several steps of “required corrective action” including:</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The order states that Vail Corp. must answer the findings and submit an answer within 30 days.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Vail Resorts replied to the notice with the following statement:</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“Vail Mountain provided a comprehensive response to (the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment) regarding the circumstances of the accidental discharge last fall which included immediate measures to ensure that the potable water discharge would not happen again in the future, and we continue to cooperate with (the department) on this matter. We are still awaiting a final Colorado Parks and Wildlife report on the cause of the fish kill that occurred in Mill Creek at the time of the discharge.”</p> ",Scott Miller,20 May 2022,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/core-act-has-an-important-meeting-set-for-tuesday/

John Hickenlooper described as a high watermark for the long-debated bill.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The CORE Act, which stands for Colorado Outdoor Recreation &amp; Economy, aims to protect roughly 400,000 acres of public lands in Colorado — adding 20,196 acres to the nearby Eagles Nest, Ptarmigan Peak, and Holy Cross wilderness areas — and also creates new wildlife conservation areas and a first-ever National Historic Landscape designation for Camp Hale. It has passed the U.S. House of Representatives four times.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources contains 10 Democrats and 10 Republicans, so there are few surprised when committee votes result in a tie.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Such was the fate of the CORE Act on Tuesday — but that doesn’t necessarily mean the legislation won’t receive a vote in the full Senate.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The tie vote Tuesday allows Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer to file a discharge motion which, if approved, would absolve the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of its duty to recommend the bill for a vote of the full Senate. It can then be placed on the Senate’s executive calendar, which would allow the Senate to proceed with consideration of the bill for a final vote.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“This is a high watermark for what we hope is the final hurdle before it passes and becomes law,” Hickenlooper said of the CORE Act in his opening remarks Tuesday.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Republicans were steadfast in their disapproval of the CORE Act’s creation of areas where new mining and mineral leases won’t be issued on federal lands.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“We need to increase American development of energy and critical minerals,” said Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming. “Now isn’t the time to be permanently withdrawing federal land.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Roughly 200,000 acres in the Thompson Divide area, which the CORE Act seeks to protect approximately from the impacts of new oil and gas leasing, was debated separately in a proposed amendment to the CORE Act, which would exclude the Thompson Divide provisions from the bill.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Sen. Mike Lee of Utah referenced a recent quote from President Biden in offering the amendment, in which <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/22/politics/biden-gas-prices-russia/index.html"" target=""_blank"">Biden pledged to use “every tool at our disposal”</a><svg class=""svg-icon""><use class=""fa-external-link-alt"" xlink:href=""#fa-external-link-alt""></use></svg> to limit the effect on gas prices in the U.S. caused by sanctions against Russia.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“Back in 2014, the Forest Service estimated that this area still has a high occurrence of oil and gas resources with a high potential for continued development and production,” Lee said. “In the words of the president, we should be using every tool in the toolbox to boost domestic production, and not stifle it.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico said his state is the No. 2 producer of oil and gas in the nation.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“I wish I could say that as we have increased our production that some of the savings would find their way to the gas pump. They have not,” Heinrich said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Hickenlooper reminded his colleagues that he spent a number of years working in the oil and gas industry. The Thompson Divide area “has some natural gas, but the cost of exploring and putting in a pipeline would never justify production,” Hickenlooper said. “There’s just not enough production that would come out of it. We also respect existing drilling rights, so the currently held leases would be protected, if someone wanted to drill on those leases, they remain effective and intact.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The amendment received a 10-10 vote on party lines and was not added to the CORE Act.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">In an ironic twist, the bill’s celebration of the WWII training ground at Camp Hale — <a href=""https://www.vaildaily.com/news/sen-michael-bennet-touts-core-act-while-celebrating-triple-deuce-day-at-camp-hale-with-veterans/"" target=""_blank"">once seen as a way to help in garnering conservative approval of the bill</a><svg class=""svg-icon""><use class=""fa-external-link-alt"" xlink:href=""#fa-external-link-alt""></use></svg> — was listed as a reason for Republicans in the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources to deny support.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“I understand the importance of historic preservation by Congress, but Congress has never designated or even debated this idea, this concept, this definition, of a National Historic Landscape,” Barrasso said. “And for this reason I oppose the bill and encourage my colleagues to do the same.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Hickenlooper said the locally driven nature of the bill creates a model for how federal land designations should be made in the future.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska, agreed with Hickenlooper in the approach to seeking a locally drafted public lands bill, and said despite voting against the bill, she hopes to see it pass it in the future.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“My hope is that we will eventually be able to get this one and perhaps several of the others across the line,” she said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Sen. Angus King, a Democrat from Maine, said he was perplexed by Murkowski and other Republicans’ rejection of the CORE Act.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“I thought one of the core principles of your side was local control, respecting and listening to local voices,” King said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Murkowski said it could be “a function of the time we’re in right now,” referencing the war in Ukraine.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“Everybody in Europe is looking to this country saying ‘how can you help us from a resource perspective?’ Whether it’s natural gas or whatever our resources might be, because we are a resource-rich state,” she said. “And so when they see that there are efforts at the administrative level to take off the table rather than to be a more broader global friend and ally in this, I think that that is part of the discussion. We’re trying to figure out where is this balance here.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia said Hickenlooper and Sen. Michael Bennet deserve a lot of credit for the widespread support the CORE Act has received.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“To get agreement from both the citizens and the industry — they both agreed — is an accomplishment you should be proud of, so hopefully we’ll keep working to get a positive reaction here,” Manchin said.</p> ",John LaConte,04 May 2022,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/core-act-has-an-important-meeting-set-for-tuesday/

The nonprofit organization’s new strategic plan calls for conserving another 40,000 to 50,000 acres in just the next decade.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">A map of AVLT’s protected lands shows it has historically been slightly more active in the Roaring Fork Valley than in the Lower Colorado River Valley. It has conserved 24,166 acres between Aspen and Glenwood Springs and offshoot valleys. It has conserved 20,766 acres in the ranchlands and farm country surrounding New Castle, Silt, Rifle and Parachute. The balance is likely to shift over the next decade.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“There are some large parcels left in the Roaring Fork Valley, but by and large most of the opportunity is in the Colorado River Valley,” said Suzanne Stephens, the executive director of AVLT for the past six years.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">It will be a hefty challenge to conserve land anywhere thanks to soaring land prices, but AVLT is undaunted. One big advantage is that Colorado has significantly sweetened the incentives. The tax credit offered by the state for conservation used to be 50 cents on the dollar. It has been boosted to 90 cents, according to Stephens.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">With few exceptions, AVLT depends on voluntary agreements with landowners rather than outright purchases of property. When it acquires a conservation easement, the landowner retains ownership but limits or surrenders development potential in return for tax credits. The appeal is often that the tax credits can often be used as revenue to plow back into a farm or ranch, Stephens said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Another challenge is some of the targeted land is also property ripe for development of affordable housing — a dire need throughout the region. AVLT is acutely aware of needs beyond preservation of open space.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“We’re not just here to commit random acts of conservation,” Stephens said in a meeting Thursday with the Pitkin County Open Space and Trails program’s board of directors.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">After the meeting, she said communities could achieve preservation of open space and development of affordable housing with proper planning.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“I truly, truly don’t think it needs to adversarial,” she said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">AVLT’s target area stretches from the Continental Divide east of Aspen to the Roan Plateau west of Parachute. That area encompasses 2.1 million acres, with the vast majority held by public land management agencies. According to AVLT statistics, 42% of the area is national forest, 21% Bureau of Land Management holdings and about 1% held by Colorado Parks and Wildlife and local open space programs.</p> <img loading=""lazy"" width=""1070"" height=""565"" src=""https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=8ba424dd-34b0-5855-80c1-27fef5f5a2b6&amp;type=preview&amp;width=1070&amp;height=590&amp;q=60"" srcset=""https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=8ba424dd-34b0-5855-80c1-27fef5f5a2b6&amp;type=preview&amp;width=300&amp;height=165&amp;q=60 300w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=8ba424dd-34b0-5855-80c1-27fef5f5a2b6&amp;type=preview&amp;width=768&amp;height=423&amp;q=60 768w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=8ba424dd-34b0-5855-80c1-27fef5f5a2b6&amp;type=preview&amp;width=1024&amp;height=565&amp;q=60 1024w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=8ba424dd-34b0-5855-80c1-27fef5f5a2b6&amp;type=preview&amp;width=2048&amp;height=1129&amp;q=60 2048w"" alt=""""> <p class=""oc-body"">That leaves 35% as private land, but the importance of that land to wildlife and food production can’t be exaggerated.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“Generally, public land occupies the higher elevations and peaks and private land covers the lower elevations and valleys,” AVLT’s website said. “The valley bottoms and lower elevations are often the most rich and productive for both wildlife and humans; they are also the most highly threatened by growth and development pressure.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">To craft its strategic plan, AVLT engaged in an extensive public engagement process where it consulted with 550 people through open houses, surveys, interviews and meetings with municipal officials. That input will help determine what lands to pursue. The plan spells out specifically the types of qualities the organization is seeking in property is conserves.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The priorities include some of the obvious attributes:</p> <p class=""oc-body"">But AVLT is also looking for opportunities that provide less obvious advantages. The organization wants to promote equity by expanding outdoor access for communities with the highest need. Stephens said conservation groups run the risk of sinking into irrelevancy when not catering to all segments of local constituents.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The organization will also gauge acquisitions by the potential to provide recreational and education for local residents.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">A final factor is acquisitions that help with climate resilience.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">To date, AVLT has protected 67 square miles, the equivalent of a strip 1 mile wide from Aspen to Rifle. If it successfully achieves its goal, that will double by 2032.</p> <p class=""oc-body""><em id=""emphasis-29a433fc1e8dec5581289e0d17903c41""><a href=""mailto:scondon@aspentimes.com"">scondon@aspentimes.com</a></em></p> ",Scott Condon,08 May 2022,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/core-act-has-an-important-meeting-set-for-tuesday/

He said the initial illness arose five to 10 days after a group of 50 horses received their first vaccinations and appeared first and most severely in that same group of horses.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The West Douglas horses were captured in early August 2021 and should have been vaccinated shortly thereafter, according to BLM Colorado Spokesperson Steven Hall.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“Part of our review of what happened in this situation, is to determine why these horses hadn’t been vaccinated,” Hall said. “Was there an issue with resources?

It is a race against time to build immunity by vaccination while the animals are increasingly exposed to these viruses and bacteria in their new environment. Unfortunately, the respiratory diseases (flu, rhino and strangles) are highly contagious and difficult to control through vaccination alone. The vaccines may help limit how quickly and severely the illness spreads in a group setting.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Kane’s report also suggested the West Douglas horses could have been compromised by smoke from the Oil Springs Fire, which burned 12,613 acres in the summer of 2021, including much of the herd’s range.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Thursday’s news release said 95 horses have died from the illness, but the death of a foal on April 18 has been deemed unrelated.

Sandhill crane chick’s arrival near Steamboat captured by camera,"<p class=""oc-body"">It was not difficult to hear the excitement in Nancy Merrill’s voice as she talked about capturing the arrival of one our area’s most anticipated babies on the Crane Camera on Tuesday.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“It’s a huge day,” said Merrill, president of the Colorado Crane Conservation Coalition. “We are so thrilled because they lost an egg Sunday (May 8) on Mother’s Day, and were devastated. So they’ve been sitting on the other egg patiently, and it hatched this morning at 10:40.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The cranes, Fred and Wilma, have been taking turns sitting on the egg. Fred was on duty when the new chick hatched. Merrill was watching her screen and waiting for Wilma’s arrival as she talked on the phone Tuesday morning.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“It was so interesting because the egg hatched while the father was on the nest,” Merrill said. “The mother is just coming back right now as we’re speaking to see her chick for the first time.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Merrill said moments like these are why the <a href=""https://www.steamboatpilot.com/news/camera-offers-glimpse-inside/"" target=""_blank"">Colorado Crane Conservation Coalition put the camera in place in an undisclosed location west of Steamboat Springs</a><svg class=""svg-icon""><use class=""fa-external-link-alt"" xlink:href=""#fa-external-link-alt""></use></svg> two years ago. She said this year, thanks to donations, the equipment was upgraded and has been far more reliable.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The only glitch came early on, when the group had to move the camera at the last moment, after the cranes that were featured on the camera last year decided to nest in a different location away from the camera’s ideal field of view.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Volunteers quickly moved the camera to a new location earlier this spring. It was a little farther away from the nest, but Fred and Wilma were not disturbed when the camera was moved.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“The best thing is the crane message is getting out to the world with everybody who is watching this,” Merrill said. “We’re taping everything so that we can play it back for everyone who missed it, and we’re pretty excited about it.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Merrill said the new baby arrived in the expected window about 30 days after the egg was laid on April 15. A second egg was laid a few days later, but it broke.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The group sent out about 2,000 emails last week letting people know that this was a good time to start watching the live feed if they wanted to see the chick’s arrival. She added that some of the crane camera’s highlight videos have been viewed up to 8,000 times. She expects this video of the father standing up and the new chick taking it’s first stroll to get lots of views, as well.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“It just stood up and walked around,” Merrill said. “I mean, it was just so adorable.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">She said crane chicks are precocial, meaning that they are able to see right away, and feed almost immediately. They actually can get up and leave the nest within a day. Merrill said that while they could anticipate the hatch, what happens afterward is much harder to predict. She said some cranes will hang out around the nest for a few days while others leave more quickly. She said the camera will continue to broadcast until the cranes leave the area.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“Often they will come back to the nest at night, but sometimes it won’t,” Merrill said. “Sometimes once they leave the nest we don’t really know how long they’re going to stick around.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The good news is that the events since the cranes started nesting in mid-April have all been recorded and are available to the <a href=""https://coloradocranes.org/"" target=""_blank"">Colorado Crane Conservation Coalition</a><svg class=""svg-icon""><use class=""fa-external-link-alt"" xlink:href=""#fa-external-link-alt""></use></svg> website. There, viewers can watch the chick hatch, the parents fend off raccoons and skunks, as well as build the nest. The camera also captured American white pelicans and a great blue heron visiting the area where the crane nest is located.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w3E5PCSqx8"" target=""_blank"">live video feed </a><svg class=""svg-icon""><use class=""fa-external-link-alt"" xlink:href=""#fa-external-link-alt""></use></svg>is made possible through grants provided by the Yampa Valley Community Foundation and the WHILD fund. Internet access for live streaming is provided by Zirkel Wireless. Camera installation and setup were completed by Photon Syndicate.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“Our organization is all about trying to keep those wetlands and open spaces for the cranes and all the other critters that live there,” Merrill said. “When you see this miracle of hatching it just inspires you to work that much harder for it.”</p> ",John F.

It might, just might, pass a crucial milestone this week.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The bill, which would protect more than 400,000 acres across the Colorado Rockies through a combination of new designated wilderness areas, recreation management and conservation areas, has passed four times through the U.S. House of Representatives. It has yet to pass muster with the U.S. Senate.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The bill this week is set for a committee hearing and possible vote by the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Sen. John Hickenlooper is a member of that committee. Tuesday’s meeting is the farthest yet the bill has made it through the process. If the bill passes out of the committee, it will head to a floor vote. If the Senate passes the bill, it will head to the desk of President Joe Biden, who has said he will sign the bill into law.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">A group of bill sponsors and supporters Monday held a virtual meeting to talk about the bill and its possible impacts.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Sen. Michael Bennet, who has championed the act for more than a decade, said the bill could be “one of the most meaningful” pieces of public lands legislation for Colorado in the past 25 years. Bennet noted that the bill has been built from the local level, and has support from Democrats, Republicans and independents. Supporters also include environmental, recreational and business interests, including, Bennet said, “an operating silver mine in Ouray County.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The bill’s major Eagle County impact would be the creation of the nation’s first-ever “national historic landscape” at Camp Hale, where the 10th Mountain Division trained during World War II.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Pitkin County Commissioner Greg Poschman is the son of a 10th Mountain Division veteran. Poschman said the CORE Act could show those still alive from the unit’s first days that “we still have lessons to learn” from that generation.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Poschman said John Tripp, who will turn 103 this year, wants to see the bill passed, not only for the Camp Hale designation, but also for the future of the Thompson Divide.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The bill is a big deal for those in the Thompson Divide area, an alpine area comprising pieces of Pitkin, Gunnison and Garfield counties.

A conviction carries a presumptive prison range of two to six years, but the plea agreement strayed from those guidelines given Diamond’s age and her admission of guilt and remorse, attorneys said. She also was not intoxicated at the time of the collision, according to prosecutor Don Nottingham.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Diamond agreed to supervised probation for the next two years as part of the agreement. She also must perform 120 hours of community service, which Diamond already is close to completing through her volunteer work at a soup kitchen in South Florida, according to her defense counsel, Kate Stimson of the Denver firm Stimson Stancil LaBranche Hubbard LLC.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The felony will be removed from Diamond’s record if she successfully completes her probation without any criminal citations or arrests. Diamond also pleaded guilty to careless driving causing injury relating to the December incident, and she entered a guilty plea to a careless driving charge related to a different incident in July.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Diamond sat next to her mother during the entire virtual arraignment hearing, which was held nearly five months after she drove a Range Rover into a Basalt man crossing East Main Street in front of the Aspen Police Department building. Victim Dave Rossi was alone crossing the street when the SUV struck him at approximately 11:52 p.m. Dec. 21, authorities said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“Certainly the most aggravating part of this case is not Ms. Diamond’s driving, which was not the greatest,” said Nottingham, adding that “it’s the fact that she left the scene. She got out of her car, saw Mr. Rossi, and left the scene, which could be described as disgusting, abhorrent, really bad behavior, really dangerous behavior. Luckily this did happen in a populated area where there were other people there who did give Mr. Rossi the help that he needed.“</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Rossi <a href=""https://www.aspentimes.com/news/victim-in-downtown-aspen-hit-and-run-slowly-recovering-in-denver/"">suffered head injuries and a broken pelvis</a>, among other injuries.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“It caused really significant injuries to Mr. Rossi,” said Nottingham. “There was certainly concern that Mr. Rossi might die from those injuries. He had to be transported via helicopter (to Denver) … from Aspen to a more capable hospital for dealing with that level of trauma.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Rossi’s attorney, Michael Fox, attended the hearing and did not object to the plea agreement. Diamond also will be ordered to pay restitution as part of the deal, though the amount has not yet been determined.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“Mr. Rossi is not here, and he does not wish to make a statement, and I don’t wish to make a statement,” Fox said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Aspen police, aided by community tips and video footage that showed the green Land Rover that Diamond was driving, arrested Diamond the day after the accident at her mother and stepfather’s Aspen residence. Diamond has taken responsibility for what happened ever since police arrested her, Nottingham said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“I would say from about that moment on, Ms. Diamond has done things just about as well as she can,” Nottingham said. “She admitted to what happened. Her mother and stepfather behaved appropriately with the appropriate amount of shock, I think, for finding out this had happened and not a desire to hide Ms. Diamond’s behavior.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Diamond made a poor choice and panicked when she left the scene, Stimson said, noting it was dark outside and she did not see Rossi because of “how he was crossing.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“Her driving was not compromised, but she did strike him,” Stimson said. “She did pull over. There were other people who attended and called 911. Then she made a bad decision of leaving. She’s a senior in high school, 18 years old, and she just made a bad decision.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Diamond will graduate this month, after which she will begin her jail sentence. She plans to attend college in California this fall.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Diamond will need permission from California’s legal authorities to continue her supervised probation when she’s in school. Diamond plans to stay with her parents this summer and start college around fall. As part of her probation, she cannot consume alcohol or marijuana.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">There was no evidence showing that Diamond was under the influence when she hit Rossi, Nottingham said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“I’m convinced that Ms. Diamond was not intoxicated,” he said. “But I don’t think, necessarily, that she, as young person, has sustained from that sort of behavior, and I do have concerns in that regard, but the evidence on a whole indicates she was not intoxicated; she was simply an 18-year-old who panicked and did something really stupid. Stupid and dangerous, I should say, and left Mr. Rossi at the scene.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">In an Aspen Times <a href=""https://www.aspentimes.com/news/victim-in-downtown-aspen-hit-and-run-slowly-recovering-in-denver/"">article published in early January</a>, Rossi said he harbored no ill will toward Diamond.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“He appears to be a remarkably forgiving person where someone might be angry and vindictive about this having happened to them,” Nottingham said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Diamond also has demonstrated that she has learned a lesson, said Nottingham.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“I think that says something about Diamond, that she has agreed to that (going to jail), from the point of view that she recognizes that this is where she ends up if she continues to engage in behavior like this,” he said. “I expect her to complete this deferred-judgment sentence successfully.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Likewise, Stimson said the sentence is appropriate.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“It does allow her to move on with her life and put this behind her, but it also recognizes the severity of what happened,” she said, noting what Rossi experienced “was horrible.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Diamond is the daughter of Aspenite Sue Hostetler, who is married to billionaire William Wrigley Jr.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“In a case like this, knowing Ms. Diamond’s age and her socio-economic position, is that Ms. Diamond may think that she’s the sort of person that gets in less trouble than some others, doesn’t see herself in the same population as some of the folks who go before a district court judge,” Nottingham said. “And it’s important to my office, it’s important to me, that she recognizes that her behavior in the eyes of the law doesn’t depend on what car she’s driving or what college she’s going to or anything else. It depends on her culpability and her actions, and for that reason, Ms. Stimson and I have worked out a disposition … she should not a face a lifetime felony conviction.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Diamond will get jail credit for the one day she already served at the time of her arrest. With good behavior, her sentence could be cut by 10 or 11 days, Nottingham said.</p> <p class=""oc-body""><em id=""emphasis-2f8fea38b4a12fc38ec664de68f64751""><a href=""mailto:rcarroll@aspentimes.com"">rcarroll@aspentimes.com</a></em></p> ",Rick Carroll,17 May 2022,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/juvenile-defendant-in-glenwood-springs-stabbing-charged-as-adult/
Victim testifies in trial of Basalt man charged with attempted sexual assault,"<p class=""oc-body"">A 24-year-old woman who was cornered in the bathroom of a downtown Aspen bar by an intoxicated man last summer didn’t hesitate Wednesday when a prosecutor asked her what she thought about his intentions.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“He would’ve raped me,” she said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The woman — a Washington D.C. resident and lifelong visitor to Aspen — was the first witness to testify Wednesday in the trial of Robert Marlow, a 41-year-old Basalt man charged with attempted sexual assault, false imprisonment and indecent exposure.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The victim had been out to dinner with a family friend the night of July 6 last year and ended up at Aspen Public House about 1 a.m. on July 7. She testified that she’d had two glasses of wine the entire evening and ordered water at Public House before heading to the bathroom about 15 minutes after arriving at the bar.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">She said she first entered the unlocked women’s bathroom and saw a tall man — later identified as Marlow — standing inside with his pants unbuttoned. She said she immediately closed the door, apologized for the intrusion and decided to use the men’s room immediately opposite the women’s room because she thought it would be a similar one-toilet facility with a locking door.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">When she entered the men’s room, however, she realized it wasn’t the exact same set-up as the women’s room, hesitated a moment and testified she felt maybe she shouldn’t be in there. At that point, the man who had been in the women’s room came “barging” into the men’s room and backed her up against the wall between a toilet stall and the sink, she said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The man put his right arm up against the wall, blocking her from leaving, and with his left hand began pulling his pants and boxers down to his knees, she said. She testified that she saw his penis, but could not recall if it was flaccid or erect.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“I was more focused on getting out,” she said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">At that point, she began kicking and screaming at the top of her lungs, she said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“I said, ‘Please don’t do this. Please let me go,’” she said, crying on the witness stand. “And he said, ‘You’re not going anywhere.’”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The woman testified that the scenario she was faced with had played out many times in her head as one of her greatest fears, and that she’d always told herself that if something like that happened she’d have 60-to-90 seconds to get out of it. In that “moment of clarity,” she said she began counting down from 60, then realized Marlow was much taller than her and that she could duck under his arm and run out of the bathroom, which she did.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">A video played in court Wednesday — as well as at a <a href=""https://www.aspentimes.com/news/judge-approves-attempted-rape-charge-against-basalt-man/"">preliminary hearing in August</a> — showed Marlow sitting at a table near the Public House bathrooms and entering the bathroom area seconds before the woman walked downstairs from the bar area to the bathrooms. The 53-second video was not positioned to record what occurred inside the bathrooms, but the audio portion recorded her screaming, and the video caught her running out of the bathroom.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The woman said she’d never seen Marlow before in her life and did not recognize him sitting at the defense table when prosecutor Don Nottingham asked if he was in the courtroom Wednesday.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">She said she did not call police that night and didn’t talk to a detective until about noon on July 7. She said she had never experienced such a “trauma” before, and that she initially thought that if she ignored what happened it would go away, though that quickly turned out not to be the case.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">On cross-examination, public defender Scott Troxell brought up inconsistencies in the woman’s account of what happened that evening. She admitted she initially told police she spent the first night after the incident at her home when she actually stayed at the family friend’s house. She also told police at one point that she hadn’t seen Marlow’s penis, though she testified Wednesday she did see it and that the memory of seeing it came back to her.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">During his opening statement, Troxell said Marlow was “blackout intoxicated” the night of the incident and also had been doing cocaine. However, he said Marlow’s reaction to the cocaine was not typical and that it had caused him to hallucinate, which he chalked up to “strange powders going around Aspen.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“You will hear that he had a blank stare (on his face),” Troxell said. “There was something wrong with him.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Regardless of what Marlow ingested, he has “very little recollection of that evening,” Troxell said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Troxell said the victim clearly believed she was about to be raped but that what actually happened doesn’t equal attempted sexual assault with force under the law.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“I won’t ask you to believe nothing happened,” Troxell told jurors. “Something happened. I’d ask you to look at the evidence. It is not attempted sexual assault with force, even if that’s what (the victim) felt it was.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Marlow’s trial — which is taking place in the basement of the former Aspen City Hall building while the Pitkin County Courthouse undergoes renovations — is scheduled to run through Monday.</p> ",Jason Auslander,07 April 2022,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/juvenile-defendant-in-glenwood-springs-stabbing-charged-as-adult/

My clients … are just looking to close this chapter in their lives.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Ninth Judicial District Judge John Neiley, who is based in Glenwood Springs, entered the award late Friday afternoon after a <a href=""https://www.aspentimes.com/news/absent-indy-pass-hostage-taker-may-be-on-hook-for-2-million/"">one-day civil court bench trial </a>March 21 during which Brian Buchanan, Mark Meredith and Blake Ramelb testified about the lasting trauma McConnell inflicted on them during the incident on <a href=""https://www.aspentimes.com/news/aspen-hostage-taker-i-told-you-i-was-going-to-kill-you/"">Lincoln Creek Road in July 2016</a>.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">McConnell did not participate in the virtual trial last week, though Neiley found that McConnell had received notice of the trial and even waited an extra 10 minutes for him to log on before beginning the proceedings.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">In his ruling, Neiley wrote that the men — who were in the their early-to-mid 20s at the time — demonstrated during their testimony “that they suffered significant emotional and psychological injuries and severe emotional distress as a direct and proximate result of McConnell’s conduct.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“He held them at gunpoint and completely terrorized them,” Neiley said. “The conduct was so outrageous in character and so extreme in degree as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency and must be regarded as atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Under Colorado law, the maximum allowed in nonmedical malpractice civil cases for noneconomic loss or injury is $250,000, “unless the court finds ‘justification’ by clear and convincing evidence to award a greater amount,” Neiley said in his ruling. The current cap for those maximum damages is $468,010, which he awarded to each of the three plaintiffs, because of the severity of McConnell’s conduct, according to the ruling.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Neiley declined to award more because higher amounts generally come only with loss of limbs, loss of senses “or other similar physically traumatic injuries.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“While the court does not mean to minimize the emotional trauma suffered by the Plaintiffs, none of them suffered permanent physical injuries or disfigurement, lost a limb or suffered a gunshot wound,” Neiley said. “With appropriate therapy and counseling, there is significant hope that the emotional impacts of the incident can be ameliorated over time.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Buchanan and Meredith first encountered McConnell’s stopped truck on Lincoln Creek Road on their way to do some bouldering and camping. McConnell pulled out two handguns, made them partially disrobe and repeatedly threatened to kill them before they were able to escape without injury.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Ramelb drove up on the scene and was also taken hostage. McConnell fired one of the guns at Ramelb’s feet and also next to his head before he, too, was able to escape without injury despite having recently had surgery on his foot.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">After spending 3½ years awaiting trial in the Pitkin County Jail — which included numerous delays after he pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity and was eventually found sane — <a href=""https://www.aspentimes.com/news/man-who-took-hostages-in-2015-incident-on-independence-pass-near-aspen-sentenced-to-12-years-in-prison/"">McConnell pleaded guilty in December 2019</a> to criminal attempt to commit first-degree kidnapping and felony menacing.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Pitkin County District Judge Chris Seldin, who said McConnell was experiencing “paranoid delusions” when he held the men hostage, sentenced him to 12 years in prison in March 2020. McConnell served less than two years before he was released on parole in January and is currently living in Texas.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Efforts to collect the $1.4 million can come in the form of garnishing wages, bank accounts or real property, Fox said.</p> ",Jason Auslander,29 March 2022,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/juvenile-defendant-in-glenwood-springs-stabbing-charged-as-adult/

He was then released from custody.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">• May 13 — Later on that date, at approximately 9:01 p.m., police received a call from The Aspen Store about a man who swiped some power drinks and was behaving aggressively toward the store clerk. Auer was not at the store at the time police responded, but Officer Ritchie Zah located him down the block in the dining area outside of Mi Chola, according to a report from Officer Roderick O’Connor.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“I asked Auer, who was smoking a cigar, about his stealing drinks from The Aspen Store and where the bag he took was located,” O’Connor’s report said. “Auer was not forthcoming about the bag, but mentioned he was at Mi Chola to eat.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">O’Connor, however, arrested Auer for theft after he found the power drinks in a bag Auer had left inside the restaurant. It was the second time in the same evening Auer had been cited for theft, but the pork meal and power drinks weren’t all he had allegedly taken.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Officer Severin, who also reported to Mi Chola, also found Auer in possession of one bottle of Opus One Cabernet with a price tag of $389.99, along with four cigars valued at $52.87. Those items had been swiped from the Local Spirits shop next to The Aspen Store, O’Connor reported.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Auer appeared for his advisement on May 14, but that is the last authorities had heard of him as of Monday.</p> <p class=""oc-body""><em id=""emphasis-8c75815ae60d46994ffbeed1ab926cd9""><a href=""mailto:rcarroll@aspentimes.com"">rcarroll@aspentimes.com</a></em></p> ",Rick Carroll,24 May 2022,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/juvenile-defendant-in-glenwood-springs-stabbing-charged-as-adult/
Chronic drunk driver arrested again on DUI charge at Aspen airport,"<p class=""oc-body"">A Roaring Fork Valley man with at least six prior drunken-driving convictions was arrested again Monday at the Aspen-Pitkin County Airport and charged with felony DUI, according to court records.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Harve Hoff, 64, had to be pulled out of the backseat of his vehicle in front of the airport arrivals door by two Pitkin County sheriff’s deputies and handcuffed after refusing to cooperate, according to a warrantless arrest affidavit filed in Pitkin County District Court.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Emergency dispatchers were first alerted to Hoff about 3:30 p.m. Monday after a caller reported that he smelled like alcohol and had a history of alcohol problems, the affidavit states. The person Hoff was supposed to pick up at the airport told an airport operations employee that she didn’t feel safe getting in the car with him.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The airport employee reported that Hoff was sitting in the front seat of a white Lexus with Texas license plates, though he had moved to the backseat by the time a deputy arrived. Hoff refused to follow directions from the deputy and repeatedly asked the person he was picking up to drive away, according to the affidavit.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Hoff was argumentative, would not get out the car, declined to speak with the deputy and had slurred, “thick-tongued” speech. He also refused to perform roadside sobriety tests and became more agitated when the deputy informed him that he was going to be arrested for drunken driving because witnesses had seen him behind the wheel.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">After another deputy arrived and helped drag Hoff out of the car, they transported him to the Pitkin County Jail. In addition to the six DUI convictions, Hoff also was the subject of several protection orders filed against him that forbid him from consuming alcohol or controlled substances as well as a suspended license.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Hoff, part of a longtime Pitkin County family whose latest address on file was in Glenwood Springs, has been arrested 17 times in the past 10 years by the Pitkin County Sheriff’s Office mostly for alcohol-related incidents, according to Sheriff’s Office records. He was charged Monday with felony DUI, driving with a suspended license, violating a protection order and violation of bail bonds conditions.</p> <p class=""oc-body""><em id=""emphasis-d049c3478a1208d253dab5748a4dbc68""><a href=""mailto:jauslander@aspentimes.com"">jauslander@aspentimes.com</a></em></p> ",Jason Auslander,06 April 2022,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/juvenile-defendant-in-glenwood-springs-stabbing-charged-as-adult/
Criminal extortion case against Silt man heads to jury trial in June,"<p class=""oc-body"">A case against a Silt man accused of harassing an undocumented immigrant is scheduled for a jury trial following a motions hearing Friday.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Mark H. Aspiri, who allegedly threatened to report a undocumented immigrant if the individual didn’t pay Aspiri more than $1,000, is scheduled to appear in court for a pretrial conference June 14, and his jury trial is slated to begin June 22. <a href=""https://www.postindependent.com/news/silt-man-pleads-not-guilty-to-multiple-charges-including-ethnic-intimidation-criminal-extortion/"" target=""_blank"">Charges against Aspiri</a><svg class=""svg-icon""><use class=""fa-external-link-alt"" xlink:href=""#fa-external-link-alt""></use></svg> include ethnic intimidation and criminal extortion.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">According to Ballotpedia, Aspiri was a 2014 Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Colorado for a brief time before dropping out.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Aspiri and his attorney Chip McCrory attended a virtual motions hearing Friday, during which 9th District Judge James Boyd ruled on motions for discovery and to suppress statements.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Glenwood Springs Police Department Det. Jeff Fain and Officer Alicia Hampton testified during the hearing on a motion to suppress statements.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Hampton testified she was dispatched Dec. 9, 2020, to speak with the victim and his translator, who alleged Aspiri threatened the victim during a call about missing wages. The conversation occurred over the phone, and Hampton said she followed up the allegations by contacting Aspiri and directing him not to contact the victim again. She didn’t recall if Aspiri acknowledged her directive, but told the court she advised Aspiri that he could be charged with harassment if he continued to contact the victim.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">McCrory questioned Hampton about taking notes during the phone call, and where those notes might be included in the incident report. Hampton said she might have written down a phone number on a notepad or entered notes on an incident report, but she did not recall which.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">On Dec. 10, 2020, Fain was working on patrol duties when he was also dispatched to speak over the phone with the victim and his translator, Fain testified.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The conversation was brief, but Fain learned the victim was in communication with two other people who had complaints about communications with Aspiri for not being paid for work completed, according to Fain’s testimony.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">During the call, the victim claimed he did not know Aspiri, but Aspiri was demanding the victim pay him money or Aspiri would turn the victim into immigration, Fain said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Fain said he followed the conversation with the victim by calling Aspiri, who allegedly denied calling the victim or threatening the victim. The detective said he also called additional numbers provided by the victim to speak with people familiar with the situation.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">McCrory asked Fain about taking notes on the call. Fain said he did not have his notes readily available and could not guarantee he took notes, but if he did, they were likely written down in a notepad.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Fain added his notes were not requested by the District Attorney’s Office as part of the case against Aspiri.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Representing the DA’s Office, attorney Heidi Bauer told Boyd she filed a request for Fain’s note as a result of the Friday testimony.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Boyd ruled to deny the motion to suppress statements.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">On motions of discovery, McCrory said his office did not receive recordings of the victim’s voicemails, which might have been provided to the police department. He also requested copies of the victim’s witnesses’ statements, copies of incident reports related to the case and any police recordings of conversation translations with the victim, who does not speak English, or non-English speaking witnesses.</p> <p class=""oc-body""><em id=""emphasis-6338c9b79075447507f5759aba9b40c5"">Reporter Ike Fredregill can be reached at 970-384-9154 or by email at <a href=""mailto:ifredregill@postindependent.com"" target=""_blank"">ifredregill@postindependent.com</a><svg class=""svg-icon""><use class=""fa-external-link-alt"" xlink:href=""#fa-external-link-alt""></use></svg>.</em></p> ",Ike Fredregill,02 April 2022,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/juvenile-defendant-in-glenwood-springs-stabbing-charged-as-adult/

The charges include one count of sexual assault to multiple counts of unlawful sexual contact and invasion of privacy, according to Johnny Lombardi, a deputy district attorney in the 5th Judicial District Attorney’s Office.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">DA Heidi McCollum said after a brief hearing that there are now 11 named victims in the case.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Gordon, 47, of New Castle, was arrested Nov. 24 by Basalt police after one of the victims contended Gordon inappropriately touched her during a massage at a Basalt business on Nov. 22. By early January, the list of alleged victims <a href=""https://www.aspentimes.com/news/basalt-massage-therapist-faces-15-charges-over-alleged-incidents-with-8-clients/"">grew to eight</a> and the alleged inappropriate touching went back to 2015 in at least one case.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Gordon was released from Eagle County Jail in late November on a $25,000 personal recognizance bond. His bond conditions prohibit him from contacting the alleged victims or working as a massage therapist while the case is active.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The Basalt Police Department posted a message on its Facebook page Jan. 28 urging any victims to contact the department, the DA’s office or RESPONSE, which helps victims of sexual assaults.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“We believe there may be other women who were victimized by Nate Gordon while he was working as a massage therapist,” Lt. Aaron Munch said in the Facebook post.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">McCollum said Monday her office continues to be contacted by potential victims in the case.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Four of the alleged victims appeared in court in Eagle on Monday and were prepared to testify in the preliminary hearing. Gordon’s attorney, Sherry Caloia, sought a continuance because she said she didn’t have enough time to look through all the evidence the DA’s office has presented in the case thus far. Plus, Caloia said, she had a severe head cold that affected her ability to represent Gordon effectively.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Eagle County Judge Rachel Olquin-Fresquez said she was “not comfortable” with either choice — proceeding with the preliminary hearing or granting the continuance. She decided to reschedule the hearing for April 22. The DA’s office must prove there is enough evidence to warrant advancing to trial on the charges facing Gordon.</p> <p class=""oc-body""><em id=""emphasis-9fd11d8bcf98986834d28ea9558716c3""><a href=""mailto:scondon@aspentimes.com"">scondon@aspentimes.com</a></em></p> ",Scott Condon,05 April 2022,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/juvenile-defendant-in-glenwood-springs-stabbing-charged-as-adult/
Teen charged with assault after striking woman with snowball from Aspen hotel roof,"<p class=""oc-body"">A 19-year-old tourist from Chicago allegedly hit a woman walking down the street in the face with a snowball from the fourth floor roof of a downtown hotel last weekend, according to a police report.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">In addition, the teen’s mother allegedly tried repeatedly to shield her son from talking to police and was also charged in the case, the report states.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“We don’t usually write people up for a friendly snowball fight,” Aspen Assistant Police Chief Bill Linn said Thursday. “But when someone gets hit like this, it’s way over the line.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Drew Benson Peters was charged with misdemeanor third-degree assault and Maia Benson, 56, also of Chicago, was charged with obstructing an officer.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“Interestingly, neither Drew or his mother asked about the well-being of the woman who had been hit with the snowball,” Aspen police Officer Roderick O’Connor wrote in his report.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The incident began at 10:45 p.m. on March 18 after a 60-year-old Texas man and his 56-year-old wife told police they’d been walking past the W Hotel on South Spring Street after dinner when the woman was struck in the face with a snowball, according to the police report.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">When officers met with the woman, “her lower left lip was red and swollen” and “she was angry,” the report states. She declined an ambulance.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">After his wife was hit, the man told police he looked up and saw a young man four stories up on the W Hotel’s pool deck.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“He spoke with the W Hotel security and they told him they had trouble with two 19-year-old males from earlier in the day, who were throwing snowballs from the pool area,” according to the police report, which was requested Monday by The Aspen Times and released Thursday.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">O’Connor was unable to track down Peters late Friday night, but received an email from the W Hotel’s director of security when he arrived for work Saturday evening. The security director told him that an employee of the Little Nell Hotel — next door to the W Hotel — had called at 7 a.m. March 18 and said two young men had been throwing snowballs from the W’s fourth-floor pool deck, the report states.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">W Hotel security went to the roof at that time, stopped the two 19-year-olds — who admitted throwing the snowballs — and recorded the room in which they were staying. After the Texas woman was struck in the face that night, the W’s security director found a surveillance camera image of the man suspected of throwing the snowball and was able to track him to the same room, according to the police report.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">O’Connor knocked on the room’s door about 8 p.m. Saturday but no one answered so he left his card. He returned later the same night, found the card gone, knocked again to no avail and left a second card. At that time, he learned that the occupants of the room were with the occupants of another nearby room, and he knocked on that door.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Benson answered and tried to “negotiate” with O’Connor, who said he was going to charge her son with assault.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“I told her there was no other option,” O’Connor wrote in the report. “I showed her the image of the male (that security) had taken. She did not recognize the male.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Benson said she’d speak to her son and call the officer back. However, he’d still not heard back after midnight, so he called Benson, who then told him she’d removed his cards “so her son would not worry about why the police were looking for him,” according to O’Connor’s report.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“She told me he was probably at one of the Aspen bars,” O’Connor reported. “I asked her if he had fake identification since he was 19. She told me, ‘No, the bars in Aspen allow people under 21 to come in if they don’t drink.’ I told her that was not the case. She told me that was what her son told her and I must be mistaken.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">O’Connor then left, but still had not heard anything by 12:50 a.m., so he returned to the hotel with an Aspen police sergeant. They knocked on Peters’ door again and received no answer, though they heard activity inside. Benson then came out into hallway and said her son wasn’t answering because he was afraid of the police, the report states.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The officers said they weren’t going anywhere until they spoke to her son, and Benson allegedly became “very evasive,” so the officer “shifted gears,” according to the report.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">O’Connor then served Benson with a summons charging her with obstruction.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“I told Benson if her son did not come out I would have an officer waiting for them in the morning as they left for the airport,” O’Connor wrote in the report. “I told her he would miss his flight because he would be arrested, placed in handcuffs and taken to jail.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Peters then came out of his room and told officers his lawyer told him not to talk to them. O’Connor, who reported that Peters matched the photo W Hotel security provided him of the alleged snowball-thrower, then served Peters with the summons for assault, which is the same as an arrest.</p> <p class=""oc-body""><em id=""emphasis-71899ab4f77fa2d1a9be08c98b2d2491""><a href=""mailto:jasulander@aspentimes.com"">jasulander@aspentimes.com</a></em></p> ",Jason Auslander,25 March 2022,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/juvenile-defendant-in-glenwood-springs-stabbing-charged-as-adult/

The agreement includes a six-month deferred judgment, meaning the conviction will be removed from Fornell’s record if he isn’t cited for any criminal transgressions through the first week of October. The city has 90 days to request a restitution amount from Fornell, which he can either accept or challenge, said Assistant City Attorney Kate Johnson.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Fornell turned himself in to Aspen police March 7, admitting to them that he spray-painted the cafe, which is located at the base of Aspen Mountain near the gondola. Based on photographs obtained by The Aspen Times and Aspen police, the <a href=""https://www.aspentimes.com/news/gorsuch-ski-cafe-windows-vandalized-late-saturday-night/"">words “Liars Go Back to Vail” were spray-painted across three windows</a> and “Liars” on another. The paint was removed the next day, which was a Sunday.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“I’m here today to admit my actions at the Gorsuch Cafe on March 5,” Fornell read from a statement to the court Wednesday. “I acted in an irresponsible way and I regret my methods. It was ill-conceived and a poor attempt to exercise my right to free speech. Had I taken time to assess the situation, I would have taken a more healthy approach to expressing my opinion.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Fornell’s remarks came after Judge Brooke Peterson allowed Gorsuch to give a statement, which began when he pulled up a seat near Fornell, looked him in the face and said, “Honestly, I don’t know you well. I don’t know what could have possibly been in your mind thinking this was the right behavior.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Peterson then stopped Gorsuch.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“Mr. Gorsuch, address me,” the judge said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Gorsuch then turned to Peterson and said Fornell’s actions went too far and harmed a family that has been part of the community for more than a half-century.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“What happened that Sunday morning or the evening before is not acceptable behavior in the community, in the city and the community where we all strive to do a good job and take care of guests, and my guests were greeted by that violent red paint that basically called me and my family liars and said ‘leave and go away from here,’” Gorsuch said. “And you know what, we’ve been in the Aspen and the retail community for 50 years. And we’ve tried to do a lot of right things for the community and supporting the community we live and work in.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“I find the behavior despicable and wrong and the slippery slope that it was on caused great havoc in the public and in my presence, in my business, to my people that work for me and to my family that lives here.”</p> <img loading=""lazy"" width=""4032"" height=""768"" src=""https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=b5f689b8-767f-5832-a3ec-66be75838e3a&amp;type=preview&amp;width=4032&amp;height=3024&amp;q=60"" srcset=""https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=b5f689b8-767f-5832-a3ec-66be75838e3a&amp;type=preview&amp;width=300&amp;height=225&amp;q=60 300w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=b5f689b8-767f-5832-a3ec-66be75838e3a&amp;type=preview&amp;width=768&amp;height=576&amp;q=60 768w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=b5f689b8-767f-5832-a3ec-66be75838e3a&amp;type=preview&amp;width=1024&amp;height=768&amp;q=60 1024w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=b5f689b8-767f-5832-a3ec-66be75838e3a&amp;type=preview&amp;width=2048&amp;height=1536&amp;q=60 2048w"" alt=""""> <p class=""oc-body"">Gorsuch’s attorney Matt Ferguson argued the case belonged in either county or district court where misdemeanor and felony cases are handled and punishments are more severe.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“If you watched the news this morning, you’ll see what the Russian troops have been doing — putting V’s all over municipal buildings there (in Ukraine),” Ferguson said. “When people destroy windows, it means a lot in our society. These things have happened, and when you write something like ‘liars’ and ‘get out of town’ and ‘go back to Vail,’ that’s intimidation. And that’s what Jeff and Jeff Gorsuch’s family felt, that’s what his children feel. They’ve been yelled at in cars because of this incident. They’re scared. This is the wrong thing to do.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Fornell <a href=""//www.aspentimes.com/news/fornell-admits-gorsuch-vandalism-was-protest-against-aspen-mountain-hotel-sale/"">previously told The Aspen Times</a> he was outraged after Gorsuch and his partners flipped nearly an acre of land on Aspen Mountain <a href=""https://www.aspentimes.com/news/gorsuch-developers-sell-slice-of-aspen-mountain-for-76-25-million/"">for $76.25 million </a>after buying it for $10 million from Aspen Skiing Co. the previous July.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The flipped land came with entitlements to build a voter-approved hotel, and was acquired by an affiliate of a Miami-based developer of luxury hotels called OKO Group, which is led by Russian-born billionaire Vladislav Doronin.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The local team of Jim DeFrancia, Gorsuch and Bryan Peterson were the face of the 2019 campaign for an 81-room Gorsuch Haus to be built at the base of the west side of Aspen Mountain near Lift One. That March, Aspen’s electorate approved the Gorsuch Haus and associated developments by 26 votes.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Fornell, himself a developer, also apologized to a number of people with one notable exception.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“I want to extend my apologies to the Aspen Police Department for occupying their time,” Fornell’s statement continued. “My apologies also go to the Aspen City Attorney’s Office for having to deal with this matter. Finally, I apologize to the court. And to your honor, you have far more important matters to attend to. I regret that I have taken your valuable time and I am truly sorry. Be certain that I take this matter seriously and I intend to live up to the obligations of the plea agreement. I try to be a good citizen, and I know that my future actions will show that I’m capable of doing so.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Ferguson then pointed out the omission.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“I would like to note who was not apologized to,” Ferguson said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Replied Judge Peterson: “I got it.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The Aspen Municipal Code describes the charge against Fornell — injury to public and private property prohibited — as “unlawful for any person to intentionally or knowingly to injure, deface, mutilate, remove, pull down, break or in any way interfere with or molest or secrete any trees, real or personal property belonging to or under the control of the City or any person within the City.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Johnson said the plea agreement with Fornell is similar to other deals the city has made for the same offense. She also noted Fornell does not have a criminal history, which factored into the outcome.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“I appreciate the victim’s statements here, but I do have to say that I think this is a fair and just resolution to these charges,” Johnson said. “It is similar to other situations that this court has addressed on the charge of injuring private property. There have been similar situations that have happened in town. Again, this has a political flair to it but the actual act itself is similar to other acts this court has dealt with.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Peterson agreed the agreement was appropriate.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“I note and recognize that Mr. Fornell, at least in my knowledge, has not apologized to the Gorsuch family and to Mr. Gorsuch, but that’s his decision and I cannot force an apology out of him,” the judge said. “That being said, I still believe the stipulation is the right way to deal with the criminal aspect of these actions, and the restitution issue remains to be seen. But for the moment and until that restitution comes back to me, the matter is closed as far as the stipulation is concerned.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The judge said he had to treat Fornell like any other defendant charged with the same offense, despite the high-profile nature of the vandalism.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“I recognize that this has been hurtful to the Gorsuch family, but I’m not sure that this court can impose a higher penalty to change that,” he said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">As a member of the Aspen Historic Preservation Commission’s board of directors, Fornell has a responsibility to behave well, Ferguson said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“Mr. Fornell sits on the HPC board and he’s supposed to show good judgment,” Ferguson said. “What he did was an abomination. You can’t tell people to leave town and call them liars.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">It cost Gorsuch around $2,500 to remove the spray-paint job, which was not water based, Ferguson said. Fornell said previously he intentionally used easy-to-remove water-based red paint.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">There could be future civil action over the incident, Ferguson said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“The bottom line is we’ve been pressing the DA to take this up as a misdemeanor or a minor felony because he has done damage,” Ferguson said. “We don’t think it was water-based paint. It took the entire day to get that paint off and it did cost about $2,500. In addition, Mr. Gorsuch has had to retain publicists and put in numerous ads in the papers, run his letters, and try to rebut some of the damage that has been done here.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The Gorsuch family is known for their skiing prowess, evidenced by Jeff Gorsuch’s 2019 induction into the Colorado Ski and Snowboard Hall of Fame, joining his parents and grandfather. The family name also can be seen on ski apparel shops throughout the state. Jeff Gorsuch’s father, <a href=""https://www.aspentimes.com/news/friends-family-reflect-on-the-legacy-of-dave-gorsuch-following-his-death-at-82/"">David</a>, is considered one of Vail’s pioneers.

Teen paints harrowing picture of relative’s alleged abuse in Roaring Fork Valley,"<p class=""oc-body"">A Pitkin County district judge Monday bound over a Rifle man for trial to face 168 criminal charges linked to his alleged physical, psychological and sexual abuse of a relative over a period of two years, including one incident where he purportedly tried to shove her off a cliff on Aspen Mountain.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Defendant Frank Seme, 44, out on a $250,000 surety bond, attended in Aspen the preliminary hearing that included brief remarks from the alleged victim, who was subpoenaed to testify by public defender Scott Troxell. Also shown during the hearing was video footage of a police detective’s interview with the girl, who said she was physically and sexually abused and traumatized by her relative starting when she was 16 years old. The physical abuse began in September 2018 and the sexual abuse in February 2019, the girl told the detective.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“If it wasn’t sexual abuse, it was physical abuse and verbal abuse,” the alleged victim told the Rifle Police Sgt. Carlos Cornejo in the interview, which was conducted Oct. 28. Nearly three hours of the interview was shown during the preliminary hearing.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Judge Chris Seldin’s ruling allows the prosecution to carry forward 53 felony counts of sexual assault against Seme, 30 felony counts of sexual assault on a child by a person in a position of trust constituting a pattern of abuse, 83 felony counts of aggravated incest, one count of second-degree assault and one misdemeanor count of third-degree assault.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Convictions on all charges could lead to multiple life sentences in prison for Seme. The sexual assault charges are punishable by 2 to 6 years to life in prison; the incest counts carry 4 to 12 years to life in prison; and each count of sexual assault on a child by a person in a position of trust constituting a pattern of abuse is punishable by 10 to 32 years to life in prison.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Seldin noted his decision was largely based on the video of the girl’s interview with the Rifle police sergeant, as well as her documenting each alleged sexual encounter — including multiple instances of intercourse — on her health app’s calendar.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“We have non-hearsay testimony to support the charge in each count,” Judge Seldin said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">According to the alleged victim’s statement to police, she moved from her home in Nebraska to her relative’s Old Snowmass-area home in June 2018, and began her junior year at a high school in the Roaring Fork Valley that fall. In September just before her 17th birthday, Seme became mad at her and beat her with a hairbrush. He was intoxicated then and normally would drink 12 beers a day, she said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The sexual abuse began in the following February and became progressively worse.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“It’s been going on since I was 17 and we lived in Snowmass,” she told Cornejo.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The alleged victim said she couldn’t break away from her relative because she felt helpless. She also told Rifle police that before her interview with them, she spent 25 minutes outside the department before she could gather herself to tell her story.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“I feel stupid for letting this go on that long … and I feel guilty for never fighting back,” she said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The girl recalled an episode in July 2019, one day before she was scheduled to take her senior pictures, when the relative took her four-wheeling up the backside of Aspen Mountain. At one point the vehicle stopped, and he wrapped a seat belt around her neck in an attempt to rape her but she was able to break free, she told Rifle police.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“We were in the middle of nowhere,” she said. “I didn’t have a cellphone; I didn’t have anything.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Seme later tried to push her off a cliff but did not succeed, she said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“He dislocated his shoulder and screamed at me and said it was my fault,” she told police.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The following October the two went to a show at Belly Up Aspen, and on the way back, while the girl was driving them home, Seme demanded she stop the car and have sex with him, she said. He also was drunk at the time, she told authorities.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">She resisted then and he struck her, and when they returned home she became sick before he sexually assaulted her, she said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“The threats and fear, what she felt, were the means and consequences that allowed [Seme] to continue the abuse,” Nottingham said during closing statements.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">After her relative kicked her out of his home in October, the victim reported the crimes to police in Rifle, where Seme was living then. Cornejo later notified Pitkin County authorities about the crimes the girl reported that occurred in Pitkin County.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Seme is out on $250,000 surety bond after authorities arrested him in December. He is due back court in June 6 for an arraignment hearing.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Monday’s hearing was held in a makeshift courtroom downstairs at the old Aspen City Hall building, while renovations continue at Pitkin County Courthouse on Main Street.</p> <p class=""oc-body""><em id=""emphasis-e8c6bdc5323aeb40ff804e8d82c20270""><a href=""mailto:rcarroll@aspentimes.com"">rcarroll@aspentimes.com</a></em></p> ",Rick Carroll,26 April 2022,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/juvenile-defendant-in-glenwood-springs-stabbing-charged-as-adult/

Barker, 43, of Aspen Village, was arrested after a tense 20 minutes that included his alleged assault of his boss and another co-worker, pursuit of two customers outside of the restaurant and a confrontation with another man who intervened, according to Basalt Police Chief Greg Knott. Barker allegedly pulled a knife on the intervenor and the intervenor responded by pulling a handgun, according to an affidavit for a warrantless arrest filed in Eagle County District Court by Basalt police.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Knott said it was fortunate the episode didn’t end in tragedy after the intervenor pulled his handgun out of a holster during the chaotic moments when the first officer, Lt. Aaron Munch, arrived on the scene. The intervenor intended to show he posed no threat to officers but the action of pulling his gun could have easily been misconstrued, Knott said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“Lt. Munch showed great restraint and control of the situation,” Knott said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The arrest warrant said a woman was drinking at the Ocean restaurant’s bar in Willits Town Center with a male companion at about 4:30 p.m. Tuesday when Barker noticed the Woody Creek Distillery logo on the woman’s shirt.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“Christopher commented stating something to the effect of ‘Your vodka sucks,’” the arrest affidavit said. “Christopher continue to give his negative opinion on Woody Creek Distillery, making it extremely uncomfortable for (the woman and man).”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The customers decided to leave but Barker continued to be aggressive toward them, according to police. The owner of the restaurant and other employees tried to restrain Barker as he attempted to chase the man and woman as they departed. The owner later told police he feared Barker wanted to physically harm the woman.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Barker allegedly elbowed his boss in the face and punched him in the stomach as Barker attempted to get at the customers. Barker also allegedly slammed another co-worker’s hand in the door while employees were trying to prevent him from attacking the customers.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Several employees of the restaurant restrained Barker while the customers departed. The customers initially entered a neighboring restaurant but left when they found it too full. Meanwhile, the Ocean’s owner ordered Barker out of the restaurant.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Barker and the two customers made contact by chance about 1½ blocks away from Ocean restaurant. He flipped them off while they flipped him off, the affidavit said. Barker allegedly gave chase and the couple ducked into a nearby business seeking refuge.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“(The female customer) was hiding in one of the offices as (the male customer) and staff requested (Barker) leave,” the affidavit said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The woman later told police she feared for her life while she was in hiding. She called a friend who lives nearby in Willits. The friend’s husband heard about the woman’s predicament and decided to help, Knott said. The intervenor went to the business where the woman was hiding and got into a physical altercation with Barker, according to witnesses.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Barker allegedly pulled out a knife used by bartenders to open wine bottles and threatened the intervenor, the affidavit said. The intervenor “showed Christopher that he had a gun,” the affidavit said. “Christopher continued to threaten (the intervenor) as he moved towards him. (The intervenor) then pulled the gun out and pointed it at Christopher.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Barker dropped his knife shortly before Lt. Munch arrived at the scene. The 911 calls to police dispatch disclosed that weapons were involved, so Munch exited his car with his handgun drawn.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Munch encountered a scene at the sidewalk along Robinson Street with one man screaming (Barker) and another man (the intervenor) a short distance away with a pistol visible in his holster, according to footage from Munch’s body cam. The Aspen Times reviewed that footage.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Munch ordered the man with the gun to get down on his knees and as the man started to comply, he calmly pulled his pistol out of the holster and set it on the ground. Munch was clearly concerned while the man was pulling out the handgun and screamed at the man to get face down to the ground and then crawl away from the gun. Almost simultaneously he ordered Barker to sit on the sidewalk. Another officer arrived and both men were placed in handcuffs for “investigative custody,” the affidavit said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Knott said he interviewed the man who intervened in the dispute and learned he had intended to show he was compliant when he removed the pistol from the holster. He said he later realized his action could have been construed differently by the police officer, according to Knott.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The intervenor wasn’t arrested though Basalt police asked the 5th Judicial District Attorney’s Office to review the incident and rule whether a charge was warranted.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Multiple witnesses, some with videos, confirmed that the intervenor pulled his handgun only after Barker made threats with a knife and allegedly yelled “I’m going to kill you,” according to the affidavit.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Officer Nino Santiago questioned Barker and said he smelled alcohol on Barker’s breath. Barker admitted he was drinking that day and that he had experienced some mental health issues, the affidavit said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Barker was arrested on suspicion of two counts of third-degree assault for actions against two of his co-workers who tried to restrain him at Ocean. He was also arrested on suspicion of criminal mischief for other actions at the restaurant.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Barker was arrested on a charge of suspicion of stalking, a class 5 felony, for following the female and male customers out of Ocean. He was arrested on suspicion of felony menacing for pulling the knife and threatening the intervenor.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">He was taken to Eagle County Detention Center on Tuesday night. Jail records show he was released Wednesday after posting $2,500 bail. His first appearance in Eagle County Court is May 6.</p> <p class=""oc-body""><em id=""emphasis-4b65001de6a93a888c2dda1dd72c31bf""><a href=""mailto:scondon@aspentimes.com"">scondon@aspentimes.com</a></em></p> ",Scott Condon,29 April 2022,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/juvenile-defendant-in-glenwood-springs-stabbing-charged-as-adult/
Johnsons retain counsel in $5.2 million fraud suit,"<p class=""oc-body"">Attorneys for a local couple entangled in a multimillion-dollar fraud lawsuit with the insurer of Aspen Skiing Co. are disputing the amount allegedly owed.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Derek and Kerri Johnson face a federal lawsuit filed in November by National Union Fire Insurance of Pittsburgh, which is seeking $5.2 million from the couple.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">That’s the amount the company said it covered for Aspen Skiing Co. and parent Henry Crown and Co.’s financial losses stemming from the couple’s ski-selling scam when Derek Johnson held an executive position with Skico. Skico and Henry Crown and Co. were reimbursed through their their “employee dishonesty” coverage with National Union Insurance. The suit maintains the Johnsons should be held responsible for that amount because of the fraudulent activity they carried out from 2006 to 2018 leading to their criminal convictions.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“Defendants dispute that the amount paid was proper,” was the entire stated position of the Johnsons in a proposed scheduling order introduced Monday in U.S. District Court. Attorneys on both sides jointly filed the proposal.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The Johnsons, in accordance with a court order, retained the pro bono defense counsel of Joshua Landy and David Tenner on April 26, according to filings. Landy and Tenner did not respond to a message seeking comment Wednesday.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“Defendant Derek Johnson, in his capacity as managing director for Aspen (Skiing Co.), purposely purchased more inventory than was actually needed by Aspen so that any inventory misappropriated by Mr. Johnson was more likely to go unnoticed by Aspen,” read an excerpt from the summary of the allegations, which was included in the proposed scheduling order. “After that inventory was misappropriated by Mr. Johnson, he removed the insignia from the inventory that identified it as property of Aspen and listed the misappropriated inventory for sale online. The Defendants accepted payment from the misappropriated inventory and shipped the misappropriated inventory to buyers in boxes that were also misappropriated from Aspen.”</p> <img loading=""lazy"" width=""300"" src=""https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=352beebb-1ea7-55c0-9a77-27923b8f9c95&amp;type=preview&amp;width=300&amp;height=450&amp;q=60"" srcset=""https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=352beebb-1ea7-55c0-9a77-27923b8f9c95&amp;type=preview&amp;width=300&amp;height=450&amp;q=60 300w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=352beebb-1ea7-55c0-9a77-27923b8f9c95&amp;type=preview&amp;width=768&amp;height=1152&amp;q=60 768w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=352beebb-1ea7-55c0-9a77-27923b8f9c95&amp;type=preview&amp;width=1024&amp;height=1536&amp;q=60 1024w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=352beebb-1ea7-55c0-9a77-27923b8f9c95&amp;type=preview&amp;width=2048&amp;height=3072&amp;q=60 2048w"" alt=""""> <p class=""oc-body"">Each Johnson admitted criminal wrongdoing.

Kerri Johnson was not a Skico employee; she pleaded guilty to Class 4 felony theft in December 2019 and was sentenced to 90 days in the Pitkin County Jail and five years of probation.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The Aspen Times asked Johnson in February, before he and his wife had counsel in the lawsuit, about the business arrangement he initially had with Aspen Skiing Co. in 2001.

Bond review scheduled in Glenwood Springs stabbing ahead of defendant’s 18th birthday,"<p class=""oc-body"">A juvenile defendant charged as an adult for attempted murder in a March 8 stabbing incident at a south Glenwood Springs home had his first hearing in adult court Thursday.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The next step before Angel Rivas Tellez turns 18 on May 13 will be to review a $250,000 bond that was set last month when the 9th District Attorney’s Office charged him as an adult and refiled his case in Garfield County District Court.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Once Tellez turns 18, he will have to be transferred from the Grand Mesa Youth Detention Center to the Garfield County Jail, unless he is able to make bond, public defender Elise Myer told District Judge James Boyd at the Thursday hearing.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Boyd agreed to set a bond review hearing ahead of that key date, the afternoon of April 22.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">At a March 23 juvenile court hearing, Myer requested a much lower bond of $15,000-$20,000.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Myer also anticipates requesting what’s called a reverse-transfer hearing, where the judge would be asked to determine if the case should be moved back to juvenile court.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">That’s unlikely to occur until a clinical psychologist can evaluate Tellez and provide a report. The earliest that could happen is June 9, Myer said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">In the meantime, she said she is still reviewing discovery from the police investigation in the case, including body camera footage and medical records of the alleged victim.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Tellez faces felony charges of attempted murder and burglary for allegedly breaking into the victim’s home using a crowbar on a basement window around 2 a.m. March 8, going to the man’s bedroom and stabbing him “at least 30 times” before fleeing the scene, according to an account provided by Deputy District Attorney Tony Hershey at the March court hearing.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The victim was transported to an area hospital and survived his injuries.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">At the Thursday hearing, Hershey asked that a protection order in place for the victims in the case, including a third-party acquaintance of Tellez and the victim, be transferred from the juvenile case to the new District Court case. Judge Boyd agreed.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">In the earlier hearing, Hershey painted a picture of a premeditated crime in which Tellez allegedly played crime games with friends and kept notes on how to break into a home with the intent of committing a violent crime.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Following the incident, the surrounding neighborhood was initially on high alert while Glenwood Springs police investigated. Tellez was quickly identified as a likely suspect, and police indicated there was not an immediate public threat.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Hershey said at the March 23 hearing that there were enough concerns expressed by officials at Tellez’s school in Glenwood Springs that the higher bond is warranted. Additional evidence has been provided on that front, Hershey said Thursday.</p> <p class=""oc-body""><em id=""emphasis-46b34f77d08113cb28f875212580dcb5"">Senior Reporter/Managing Editor John Stroud can be reached at 970-384-9160 or <a href=""mailto:jstroud@postindependent.com"" target=""_blank"">jstroud@postindependent.com</a><svg class=""svg-icon""><use class=""fa-external-link-alt"" xlink:href=""#fa-external-link-alt""></use></svg>.</em></p> ",John Stroud,09 April 2022,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/juvenile-defendant-in-glenwood-springs-stabbing-charged-as-adult/
Jurors to resume deliberations Monday in attempted sex assault trial,"<p class=""oc-body"">After spending most of Friday afternoon deliberating the fate of a Basalt man charged with attempting to rape an Aspen visitor in the bathroom of a downtown bar last summer, jurors were sent home after 5 p.m. without coming to a verdict.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Deliberations will resume Monday morning.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Robert Marlow, 41, is charged with attempted sexual assault, false imprisonment and indecent exposure in relation to the incident, which occurred at Aspen Public House in the early morning hours of July 7.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Jurors received the case about 12:30 p.m. after lawyers concluded closing arguments and deliberated until about 5:20 p.m., when District Judge Chris Seldin called them back into the courtroom to check on their progress. At least two jurors indicated they had other obligations and could not continue the deliberations Friday evening, and Seldin sent them home for the weekend.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The 24-year-old victim in the case — a resident of Washington, D.C. — testified Wednesday that a drunken Marlow followed her in to a bathroom at Public House about 1 a.m., forced her up against the wall, blocked her from leaving, pulled down his pants and boxers and told her she couldn’t leave. The woman, who was convinced she was about to be raped, said she screamed, then kicked and punched Marlow before ducking under his arm and running out.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Marlow testified in his own defense Friday and told jurors he worked as a heavy equipment operator in Glenwood Springs during the day on July 6, then met a friend for two beers at a brewery nearby. He said he returned to his home at Aspen Skiing Co.’s tiny-home development — he worked for Skico as a lift mechanic the previous winter — in the mid-Roaring Fork Valley, where he ate and showered.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Marlow said he then drove to Aspen and went to Eric’s Bar, where he was employed as a security doorman but was not on duty that night, and had five beers and two shots. He also said he “scored” a gram of cocaine from a co-worker at the bar and did two or three “key bumps” in the bathroom.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Marlow testified that he’d done cocaine more than 50 times before, but that this time it affected him differently and made him sluggish and discombobulated instead of stimulated. Not long after ingesting the cocaine, he said his co-worker noticed he was very intoxicated and asked him to leave the bar “before you make an ass of yourself.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“I definitely appeared pretty wasted to him,” Marlow said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">He then walked over the Aspen Public House, where he said he was thinking of doing more cocaine. He testified that he remembered sitting down at a table near the bathrooms and remembered getting up to go to the bathroom to do more drugs.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">That was when Marlow said he remembered hearing a woman scream, but had “no clue what was going on.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“Obviously there was a woman in the bathroom and she ran out the door,” he said.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">He then left the bar after a bartender asked him to go, and walked around Aspen aimlessly looking for his car while hallucinating lights and colors until 4:30 a.m. When police showed up at his home two days later, Marlow said he didn’t know why they were there and thought maybe he’d gotten into a fight.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Prosecutor Don Nottingham, however, played a video of Marlow’s interview with an Aspen Police detective, where he said he remembered a girl screaming. Marlow then admitted he knew the police visit had to do with his interaction in the bathroom with the woman who screamed.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Marlow said he “froze” when he heard the scream and recalled the woman running out the bathroom door.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“Anybody that screams like that — it is terrifying,” he said. “Because it is an emergency sound. They were loud. They were very scary — like horror movie screams. It did scare me and it did make me freeze.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Nottingham pointed out that Marlow appeared to remember many details of the night, except the 15 seconds when the victim screamed, kicked and punched her way out of the bathroom, the audio of which was recorded on a video surveillance camera outside the bathrooms. Marlow confirmed that he did not remember what happened inside the bathroom.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“Of course, that’s when his memory goes blank,” Nottingham said in his closing arguments. “If he wasn’t trying to sexually assault her in the Public House bathroom, what could he possibly have been doing? What other possible explanation can there be for that? There is none.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Scott Troxell, Marlow’s public defender, cast doubt on the victim’s version of events, criticized police for not gathering DNA evidence or even photos of the victim’s alleged bruises and said the facts “fall short of what is alleged by the prosecution.” He said her clothes were not ruffled or stretched and that there was no proof Marlow committed any act of force on her.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“(The victim) was traumatized,” Troxell said. “But that doesn’t mean everything that came out of her mouth (in testimony) was the truth.”</p> <p class=""oc-body"">He said Marlow never assaulted the woman.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">“I ask you to find that Mr. Marlow did not commit any act of force on the victim,” Troxell said. “If anything, it was unlawful sexual contact.”</p> <p class=""oc-body""><em id=""emphasis-0929e42250dcb2ec7e08d6ec86ef50d4""><a href=""mailto:jauslander@aspentimes.com"">jauslander@aspentimes.com</a></em></p> ",Jason Auslander,09 April 2022,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/juvenile-defendant-in-glenwood-springs-stabbing-charged-as-adult/
Jury finds Basalt man guilty of attack on woman in bar bathroom,"<p class=""oc-body"">A Pitkin County jury on Monday found a Basalt man guilty of attempted sexual assault, false imprisonment and indecent exposure for attacking an Aspen visitor in the bathroom of a downtown bar last summer.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Robert Marlow, 41, now faces possible life in prison when he is sentenced June 21.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The jury of seven women and five men spent nearly all of Friday afternoon and all of Monday morning deliberating before coming back with the verdict just before 1 p.m. In addition to the findings of guilt on all counts, jurors also found that Marlow used “force of violence” in attempting to sexually assault the then-23-year-old woman.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">That finding is particularly significant because it means Marlow is guilty of a higher level felony and will face 2-to-6 years to life in prison and 10 years to life on parole when and if he’s released from prison, said Deputy District Attorney Don Nottingham, who prosecuted the case. Marlow would have been looking at between 1 and 3 years in prison if the jury had found him guilty of attempted sexual assault without the force of violence finding.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Indecent exposure and false imprisonment are misdemeanors for which Marlow can receive up to 18 months and up to 364 days respectively.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The Pitkin County Probation Department will conduct both a pre-sentence investigation and psycho-sexual evaluation prior to the June sentencing date.</p> <img loading=""lazy"" width=""300"" src=""https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=9223d685-d83c-5dd5-b592-68d4b9fc0a3b&amp;type=preview&amp;width=300&amp;height=381&amp;q=60"" srcset=""https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=9223d685-d83c-5dd5-b592-68d4b9fc0a3b&amp;type=preview&amp;width=300&amp;height=381&amp;q=60 300w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=9223d685-d83c-5dd5-b592-68d4b9fc0a3b&amp;type=preview&amp;width=768&amp;height=976&amp;q=60 768w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=9223d685-d83c-5dd5-b592-68d4b9fc0a3b&amp;type=preview&amp;width=1024&amp;height=1301&amp;q=60 1024w,https://imengine.public.prod.sci.navigacloud.com/?uuid=9223d685-d83c-5dd5-b592-68d4b9fc0a3b&amp;type=preview&amp;width=2048&amp;height=2603&amp;q=60 2048w"" alt=""""> <p class=""oc-body"">Attorneys in the case spent almost as much time picking the jury as they did presenting evidence in the case. Jury selection took all of April 5 and half of the next day. Testimony and arguments in the case occurred Wednesday afternoon, Thursday morning and Friday morning.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The first witness to testify was the now-24-year-old victim in the case, a resident of Washington, D.C., <a href=""https://www.aspentimes.com/news/victim-testifies-in-trial-of-basalt-man-charged-with-attempted-sexual-assault/"">who told jurors</a> she had been coming to visit Aspen her entire life because her parents met here.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">She described a night out July 6 with a family friend that finished up at Aspen Public House about 1 a.m. July 7. The woman said she’d had two glasses of wine the entire night, ordered water at the Public House bar when she arrived, then went to use the bathroom about 15 minutes later.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">She said she first went to the women’s bathroom, but when she opened the door she encountered Marlow standing inside with his pants unbuttoned. She described being slightly embarrassed, apologized and shut the door.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The woman said she decided to use the men’s bathroom immediately across from the women’s bathroom on the assumption that it was a one-toilet facility like the women’s room and likely had a locking door. When she opened the door, however, she noticed it was set up differently with a urinal and a stall and said she hesitated a moment while deciding if she should use that bathroom.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">That was when she said a clearly intoxicated Marlow came “barging” through the door, backed her up against the wall between the urinal and the sink, put his right arm up to block her from leaving and began pulling down his pants and boxers. She said he exposed himself to her at that point.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">The woman, who is much smaller than the 6-foot-1, 260 pound Marlow, said she asked him not to do anything to her and to let her go, but he responded, “You’re not going anywhere.” She said she then began screaming, punching and kicking at Marlow and was able to duck under his arm and run out the door to safety.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">She later said she thought he would have raped her if she hadn’t been able to get away. A video surveillance camera outside the bathroom recorded her screams and her running away from the bathroom area.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Marlow testified that he’d been drinking and doing cocaine that night and that while he remembered most details, including arriving at Public House, sitting at a table outside the bathroom and getting up to go to the bathroom to do more cocaine, he didn’t remember what occurred inside the bathroom except for the woman screaming.</p> <p class=""oc-body"">Marlow is currently being held at the Garfield County Jail, which is housing Pitkin County Jail inmates while county officials make changes to the jail to improve safety.</p> ",Jason Auslander,12 April 2022,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/juvenile-defendant-in-glenwood-springs-stabbing-charged-as-adult/
